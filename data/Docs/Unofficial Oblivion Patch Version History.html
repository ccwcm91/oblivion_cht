<li>Corrected Shuravi directing the player to the north wing of the Three Sisters when the room was to the north (Sound\Voice\Oblivion.esm\Argonian\F\ BedRental_BedYes_000B984F_2.mp3, Sound\Voice\Oblivion.esm\Argonian\F\ BedRental_BedYes_000B984F_2.lip).</li>
<li>Corrected Shamada calling the Three Sisters Inn the “Three Sister Inn” (Sound\Voice\Oblivion.esm\Argonian\F\ NQDLeyawiin_GREETING_000475AC_1.mp3, Sound\Voice\Oblivion.esm\Argonian\F\ NQDLeyawiin_GREETING_000475AC_1.lip).</li>

<li>Corrected a small audio flub in one of Biene Amelion’s lines (Sound\Voice\Oblivion.esm\Imperial\F\ FGC07Heirloom_FGC07Choice3_000091FD_1.mp3, Sound\Voice\Oblivion.esm\Imperial\F\ FGC07Heirloom_FGC07Choice3_000091FD_1.lip).</li>
<li>Corrected a line from Kurdan gro-Dragol where “tells me” had been read as “tell me” (Sound\Voice\Oblivion.esm\Nord\M\ MS08_MS08KurdanJar_0001F42D_3.mp3, Sound\Voice\Oblivion.esm\Nord\M\ MS08_MS08KurdanJar_0001F42D_3.lip).</li>
<li>Corrected a subtitle flub carried over into the audio in a line from Armand Christophe during TG03Elven (Sound\Voice\Oblivion.esm\Redguard\M\ TG03Elven_GREETING_00034E9A_2.mp3, Sound\Voice\Oblivion.esm\Redguard\M\ TG03Elven_GREETING_00034E9A_2.lip).</li>
</ul>

<b>NPC, Creature & AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected the sheep in the Sea Tub Clarabella being attacked by the pirates.</li>
<li>Corrected Ancotar’s invisible creatures attacking Ancotar due to missing a missing faction.</li>
<li>Corrected several AI packages for exploring the Five Claws Lodge that were set to “travel” rather than “wander.”</li>
<li>Corrected Matthias Draconis’ patrolling beginning one hour before the rest of his patrol would continue; also adjusted his sleep time to match.</li>
<li>Delayed Burz gro-Khash’s sparring to coincide with the schedule of his sparring partner, Keld of the Isles.</li>
<li>Corrected guards in the Elven Gardens district and the Imperial Palace carrying two sets of clothing.</li>
<li>Corrected the Summitmist Manor houseguests being able to yield to the player.</li>
<li>Raised Graklak gro-Buglump’s responsibility so that he will no longer incite the ire of NPCs in the West Weald Inn.</li>

<li>Corrected the residents of Border Watch carrying several leveled sets of clothing in addition to a preset outfit.</li>
<li>Adamus Phillida’s bodyguard will now be a quest item until his body is searched after his suicide.</li>
<li>Corrected the Leyawiin guard outside the Leyawiin Oblivion gate not being a quest item.</li>
<li>Corrected several jailors who were escorting the player during their off hours due to not having separate packages for day and night shifts.</li>
<li>When renting a room at the Jerall View, the lower level needed to be flagged as public to prevent Logvar from accusing the player of trespassing if they rented a room.</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Newheim’s flagon was not a quest item.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest & Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>In “The Desolate Mine,” corrected the goblins becoming hostile to the player if they ventured too far back in the first room; they will now be disabled at stage 10 and re-enabled either at stage 30 or if they player steals the key from Rienna and ventures farther into the mine on their own.</li>
<li>Corrected Aldos Othran being disabled if MS10 completed without his death.</li>
<li>Corrected a quest pointed during MS14 pointing to the Lythandas’ front door rather than Tivela.</li>
<li>It is no longer possible to activate Rythe while he’s painting the portal home as doing so could break the quest.</li>
<li>Corrected the handle that opens the door to Fort Grief being enabled too early during MS08.</li>
<li>The Night Mother can no longer be spoken to, and Matthieu Bellamont can no longer be yielded to, during “Honor Thy Mother.”</li>

</ul>

<b>Mesh & Texture Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Several gaps, UV errors, flipped normals, texture seams, deformed faces, and other issues have been corrected on CheydinhalHouseMiddle06. (Meshes\Architecture\Cheydinhal\CheydinhalHouseMiddle06.NIF)</li>
<li>Fixed bad UV/texture scaling on Chorrolhousemiddle07. (Meshes\Architecture\Chorrol\chorrolhousemiddle07.nif)</li>
<li>Fixed missing wood pillars, bad UV maps, bad alignment on the roof beams, and plaster clipping through walls for FarmHouseInterior04Top. (Meshes\Architecture\FarmHouse\FarmHouseInterior04Top.NIF)</li>
</ul>

<b>Placement, Layout and Ownership Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected an iron shortsword buried in the ground in Onyx Caverns Bridge (ref 000A6F00).</li>
<li>Corrected a barrel buried in the ground in the Leyawiin Fighters Guild Basement (ref 00048ADC).</li>
<li>Corrected a flying bottle of mead in the Bruma Fighters Guild Basement (ref 000A20A2).</li>
<li>Corrected several vegetables that were not placed correctly in the bowl they were sitting in in the Cheydinhal Sanctuary Living Quarters (refs 000A48C0, 000A48C4, 000A48C5, 000A48C6, and 000A48C7).</li>
<li>Corrected a book hidden under a dresser in the Three Sisters Inn 3rd Floor North (ref 0005DE3E).</li>
<li>Corrected Aldos Othran’s bed being unowned (ref 000986C6).</li>
<li>Corrected the position of the door to Ulrich Leland’s room (refs 00000F95 and 16455).</li>
<li>Corrected a small gap visible above the stairs near where you enter in the Old Way.</li>
<li>Corrected the left-hand door in Castle Cheydinhal’s county hall being unlocked despite leading to a restricted area (ref 00031E73).</li>
<li>Corrected the door to the Cheydinhal Fighters Guild being unowned and unlocked, which meant that the porter could  not lock it (ref 00030480).</li>
<li>Corrected Ancotar’s bedroll being unowned (ref 00009A64).</li>
<li>Corrected a skull, a scroll, and two beer bottles that could not be picked up in the exterior of Fort Empire (refs 000C49AF, 000C49B0, 000C49B2, 000C49B2).</li>
</ul>

<b>Text & Subtitle Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected an extra space in the message for attempting to pickpocket an NPC who had already caught you.</li>
<li>Corrected “S’Krivva” -> “S’krivva” (all instances).</li>
<li>Removed a few excess periods from the log entries for TGStolenGoods.</li>
<li>Corrected the name of AbWeaknessShock (“Weakness to Fire” -> “Weakness to Shock”).</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.5.2 (2015-01-31)</p>
<b>UOP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Saveri Faram no longer sleeps in Jearl’s house; there was an unused bed in Jearl’s basement.</li>
<li>The vampire hunters from MG13Information no longer hunt vampires after the quest; instead, they will be disabled if they were convinced to leave.</li>
<li>Somehow an edited audio file had not been updated with the new version, causing the audio to not match the text (High Elf/F/ MG00General_MagesGuildTopic_00062614_1.mp3 and MG00General_MagesGuildTopic_00062614_1.lip).</li>
<li>Re-wrote J’skar’s script – in MG14Plot, it was intended that you kill Camilla Lollia before J’skar would speak to you, but the Unofficial Patch had commented out the entirety of the OnActivate block in J’skar’s script because it was causing audio for his greetings not to play. Re-wrote the OnActivate block (properly this time) and hence it is now necessary to kill Camilla to progress the quest.</li>
<li>It was still possible for NPCs to say that Earana had left town when she was still present.</li>
<li>Previous edits to MS05 had not only ignored that Bethesda intended that the player complete either “Through a Nightmare, Darkly” or “Bravil Recommendation” before pursuing the other, but raised the quest’s priority so high that its dialogue was blocking Kud-Ei’s lines in MG03Illusion. Now “Bravil Recommendation” will be blocked if the player agreed to help Kud-Ei find Henantier but has not finished MS05, and MS05 will be blocked if the player began, but did not complete, MG03Illusion. Also, speaking to townsfolk about Kud-Ei will no longer open the “Henantier” topic with her before she has even told you who’s missing.</li>
<li>Hal-Liurz’s script has been reverted to vanilla; the changes the Unofficial Patch made are unnecessary now (an attempt to solve her not fetching the Count during MQ11 if MS40 had been completed; the real cause was MS40 not stopping when complete, and that bug has been dealt with for a long time).</li>
<li>Removed two Unofficial Patch-added guard greetings in favor of simply adjusting the positioning of the vanilla greetings they were based on.</li>
<li>The fix for NPCs not being able to pass through the Arcane University gates did not take into account the lobby doors re-locking when the cell reset. Also, the retroactive update will no longer allow the player to pass through the doors even if expelled.</li>
<li>Dorian's added sleep package had no time parameters, causing him to sleep forever.</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Summon Skeletal Guardian was using the icon for an archer summon even though the creature itself does not carry bows.</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Raminus Polus indicated that Warlocks were free to access the Council Chambers, when actually that privilege had been available since Magician rank; swapped the text of the advancement dialogues to Magician and Warlock ranks and edited the audio to match (Imperial/M/MG00General_Advancement_00188F40_1.mp3, MG00General_Advancement_00188F40_1.lip, MG00General_Advancement_00188F41_1.mp3, and MG00General_Advancement_00188F41_1.lip). Because the player does not receive a promotion to Warlock rank until completing “Liberation or Apprehension?” and completing that quest requires speaking to Hannibal Traven, who never leaves the upper floors of the tower,  it was necessary to change the audio and text rather than edit the ownership of the floors.</li>
<li>The .lip file for an edited line in MG09Motives appears to have not worked; regenerated it (Imperial/M/MG09Motives_GREETING_00035672_3.lip).</li>
<li>Mog gra-Mogakh says that the room for rent is to the west of the building when actually it is to the east (well, southeast, but that’s picking nits) (Nord/F/BedRental_BedYes_0003B34B_1.mp3 and BedRental_BedYes_0003B34B_1.lip).</li>
<li>Redid the audio fix for Varnado mispronouncing his own name (Reguard/M/NQDImperialCity_GREETING_00047676_1.mp3 and NQDImperialCity_GREETING_00047676_1.lip).</li>
<li>Corrected an NQDChorrol line that referred to Seed-Neeus as male (the subtitle and Nord female audio were correct).</li>
<li>Corrected the female Imperial/Breton response to TGGrayFox, where "when they catch him" had been read as "where they can catch him."</li>
</ul>

<b>NPC, Creature & AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Etira Moslin does not become hostile if attacked due to an incorrect aggression setting.</li>
<li>Mariette Rielle can no longer be yielded to – if spoken to she would repeat her MG12Gate greeting and restart combat with the player; if not, she would remain benignly inside Nenyond Twill for the rest of the game. Her aggression will also be raised so that she remains hostile if the player evades her.</li>
<li>Arterion and Mondrar Henim can no longer be yielded to, as it is necessary to kill them for MG09Motives to progress.</li>
<li>Camilla Lollia’s responsibility has been lowered to 0, matching other necromancers, so that she will no longer care about thefts from the Bruma Mages Guild.</li>
<li>It is now possible to yield to Caranya before MG16Amulet has begun.</li>
<li>Caranya’s MG16CaranyaWanderAtMark package was under MQ16MartialLaw; this meant that if MQ16 and MG16Amulet were running concurrently, Caranya would run back to the Arcane University from Fort Ontus.</li>
<li>Resurrecting Caranya via spell no longer produces multiple copies of the Necromancer’s Amulet.</li>
<li>It is no longer possible to yield to Hindaril, as he must be killed to acquire his quest-related vampire dust. He was also missing the disease necessary to infect the player with vampirism, and the Embrace of Shadows and Hunter’s Sight powers, which all other vampire NPCs possess.</li>
<li>Alix Lencolia did not sleep; created new package UOPAlixLencoliaSleep0x6 and assigned a bed (97708) for his use. He now also carries the Faregyl Inn Key so that he can unlock the door.</li>
<li>Removed the “owner follow” packages from Casta Scribonia, Ariela Doran, and Carmen Litte. Not only were they redundant, but they would cause these NPCs to immediately demand that you leave their home, even when you are not trespassing.</li>
<li>Erthor will now appropriately follow his intended schedule of spending half the week in Skingrad and half the week in Bleak Flats Cave, rather than spending only one day a week at the guildhall.</li>
<li>Mog gra-Mogakh did not sleep, despite having a bed available; assigned unused package MoggraMogakhSleep to her.</li>
<li>Quill-Weave would get stuck outside Casta Scribonia’s house during her monthly trip there. Created a new faction for Casta and Quill-Weave, set the ownership of Casta’s bed and door to the faction, and gave Quill-Weave a copy of Casta’s house key.</li>
<li>Quill-Weave will now no longer take her Chorrol trip if Casta Scribonia is dead, or if “A Rat Problem” is running.</li>
<li>Teekeeus’ MG05ATeekeeusSecuresBook package was under TeekeeusPracticeSummoning9x3 in is package list, which would cause Teekeeus to delay putting the “Fingers of the Mountain” book away if he was given it between 9 AM and 12 PM.</li>
<li>The Worm Anchorite’s responsibility has been lowered to 0 to match other necromancers, so he no longer cares about crimes he witnesses.</li>
<li>If all three Dark Brotherhood Murderers died once, or any one died twice, it was no longer possible to recruit them as followers.</li>
<li>Killing any Dark Brotherhood Murderer, regardless of whether they were your follower or not, would dismiss your Dark Brotherhood follower.</li>
<li>AnvilDailyWorshipEveningUseAltar1, AnvilDailyWorshipMorningUseAltar1, AnvilDailyWorshipMorningUseAltar2, and AnvilDailyWorshipMorningUseAltar3 all had their location data set to a marker in the center of the Chapel of Dibella, which would cause the altars to fire their blessings across the room to reach the NPCs using them.</li>
<li>Apprentice1FollowPlayer, Apprentice2FollowPlayer, Apprentice3FollowPlayer, Apprentice4FollowPlayer, Apprentice5FollowPlayer, Apprentice6FollowPlayer, Apprentice7FollowPlayer, Apprentice8FollowPlayer, Apprentice9FollowPlayer, and Apprentice10FollowPlayer have all been flagged “skip fallout behavior,” which will prevent Mage Apprentices from ceasing following in order to engage in random conversations with other NPCs (they will still converse if told to wait, though).</li>
<li>MG09MercatorAmbushExplore is now cancelled by the quest script rather than running from 10 PM to 4 AM – Mercator Hosidus would still use his quest-related greetings but would begin heading back to Castle Skingrad.</li>
<li>MG13HalLiurzTalktoCount had erroneous location data set, which would cause Hal-Liurz to return to the center of Castle Skingrad’s Great Hall before fetching the Count.</li>
<li>Count Hassildor will no longer engage in conversation with other NPCs while he’s meant to be approaching you.</li>
<li>Count and Rona Hassildor will no longer use inappropriate hellos to the player during their scene in the Chamber of the Lost during “Vampire Cure.”</li>
<li>SkingradHalLiurzSpeakToCount and SkingradShumgroYarugWaitOnCount will no longer run while Count Hassildor is assisting the player with Mercator or in the Chamber of the Lost.</li>
<li>Captain Dion will no longer hunt the player down to interrogate him or her about Glarthir if the first time the player asked about Glarthir was to show a guard the “list of death.”</li>
<li>Roland Jenseric could not sleep because MS23RolandPostQuestSleep0x8 was instructing him to sleep on the ground floor of his house, where there were no beds.</li>
<li>Dro'shanji had an AI pack would unnecessarily keep him locked up at home during MS05.</li>
<li>Several more wander AI packs with "in cell" as their destination have been fixed.</li>
<li>Most of the "use altar" AI packs were wrongly configured and could cause the NPCs to stand at altars and activate them repeatedly.</li>
<li>Corrected Oghash gra-Magul's script and AI packages so that her skooma running will work as intended: she will no longer leave her horse in the Waterfront, she will properly collect the skooma she came to get instead of leaving it in the barrel, she will no longer give the Cammona Tong thugs a "freebie" bottle of skooma, and she will keep her cut when paying off Dulfish gro-Orum instead of handing over all her gold.</li>
<li>Ley Marillin was not a member of the MarillinFamily faction.</li>
<li>Pista Marillin was intended to sleep between midnight and six AM; added a bed on the ground floor of the King and Queen Tavern so that she can.</li>
<li>Valus Odiil will no longer break off his weekend visits to his farm post-MS18 to try to return to Chorrol due to gaps in his schedule.</li>
<li>Aryarie no longer carries her shield ring before giving it to the player, as being a leveled item, it would return when the player leveled up.</li>
<li>Re-arranged Gaturn gro-Gonk's schedule so that he can sleep instead of fighting Earana for the available bed.</li>
<li>The Dark Brotherhood Murderers have been removed from the PlayerFaction; this was causing them to not be considered "evil," which would cause them to respond inappropriately to crimes they witnessed.</li>
<li>DAAzuraVampire1 will no longer produce two vampire dusts on his death due to having one as a death item and one in his inventory.</li>
<li>Antus Odiil was not returning to the Grey Mare to see his father during MS18 due to only going there via following Ralus (who might've died in the battle).</li>
<li>Earana's packages to secure the Fingers of the Mountain book were not running if she was given the book after initially giving it to Teekeeus.</li>
<li>Corrected the Gray Fox's sit package during TG11Heist so that he doesn't immediately stand up as soon as he's finished speaking to the player.</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected Roderick's medicine and poison having potion icons but looking like silver carafes when dropped.</li>
<li>Corrected the Languorwine Antidote looking like an inkwell when dropped.</li>
<li>The leveled list contents previously in the UOPS Additional Changes.esp file have been merged. UOPS Additional Changes.esp will no longer be distributed from this point forward.</li>
<li>Corrected the Robe of Creativity only occupying the upper body slot despite being a robe.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest & Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Three dialogue options meant to be used after the end of Canvas the Castle (MS51) were incorrectly checking conditions on MS05, which has nothing to do with this quest.</li>
<li>Countess Valga retained the "Gather Clues" dialogue in MS51 even after being asked both times about it due to a missing condition check.</li>
<li>Countess Valga still greets the player as the investigator in MS51 after turning in the painting due to a missing stage check.</li>
<li>In MS51, if the player accuses Orgnolf Hairy-Legs of the crime but later properly accuses Chanel, they are rewarded with +25 disposition. This should only happen when Chanel was the only accused party but the disposition reward was not given there.</li>
<li>Vlahonder Moslin was offering his bed rental dialogue even when not at the Hackdirt inn.</li>
<li>During A Shadow Over Hackdirt (MS45), killing either Etira or Vlahonder Moslin will still present quest journals as though they were alive. New entries have been added that simply state you found either Dar-Ma's horse or her diary without mentioning the Moslins if they are dead.</li>
<li>Speaking to Jiv Harel during MS45 outside his house after he tells you to go talk to him there did not present his unique greeting about being too close to other NPCs because of a bad condition check.</li>
<li>NPCs in Skingrad would still talk about someone wanting to hurt Toutius Sextius even after Paranoia (MS38) was completed and Glarthir was dead.</li>
<li>During the Skingrad Recommendation (MG01Destruct) Erthor's "follow" and "wait" commands are not supposed to remain available once he is in Skingrad.</li>
<li>If Alerone Loche dies in Caught in the Hunt (MS08) because the player killed him, killing Kurdan counts as murder. Kurdan will now attack the player if this takes place.</li>
<li>In MS08, it was possible to kill just the orc hunter if the player had high acrobatics. Doing so would trigger a journal entry saying the player had defeated all of the hunters even though they hadn't.</li>
<li>NPCs in the Imperial City who are in the legion awkwardly use dialogue talking about friends who are in the legion after Falien is killed.</li>
<li>S’drassa’s display case (7BE47) will now be shut and re-locked before the Tears he places are enabled. In order to accomplish this, the display case had to be marked as a persistent reference in order for it to be used it scripts.</li>
<li>Stage 100 in MG14Plot will no longer bizarrely disable Baragon’s chair in Cloud Ruler Temple.</li>
<li>Falcar will now be disabled at the end of MG17Ambush, along with the battlemages, as it was possible to complete the quest without his death, resulting in him hanging around Silorn for the rest of the game.</li>
<li>In MG18KingofWorms, it is no longer possible to pickpocket Bolor Savel for the Echo Cave Key; not only would that cause him to stand around like a lump for the rest of the game, Mannimarco makes reference to Bolor as though he were dead. The key now appears when Bolor is killed.</li>
<li>If S’drassa is killed before “Tears of the Savior” is completed, the Tears will no longer remain quest items.</li>
<li>“Paranoia” would never shut down if all of Glarthir’s suspects were dead before he began his “rampage”; on the off chance that this occurs, the quest will simply shut down and NPCs will fall back to describing Glarthir as “harmless.”</li>
<li>Completing MS40 will now remove the quest item flag from Hindaril’s ashes (being a death item, it was possible to acquire more than one by reanimating Hindaril, though Melisande would only ever take one).</li>
<li>In MG08MagesStaff, it was possible to receive your staff as soon as the next game day rolled around, whether or not twenty-four hours had passed.</li>
<li>In MG17Ambush, Falcar’s responsibility will be lower to 0 when he’s moved to Silorn, in order to prevent him crying about assaults against his necromancers or the battlemages.</li>
<li>In MG17Ambush, a GetDistance check against a marker, used to check if it was alright to move Falcar to his spot in the ruins, was unreliable because Falcar was traveling past and not to the marker. It has been replaced with a GetInCell check.</li>
<li>In MG17Ambush, Falcar is not intended to fight while outside. If he is spoken to before he enters the ruin, the script will delay having him start combat until he reaches his proper spot.</li>
<li>In MG18KingofWorms, Raminus Polus will no longer forcegreet you if you are expelled from the Mages Guild, as this caused an infinite loop if you did not have the ingredients necessary to rejoin.</li>
<li>Killing Beradette Peneles, Toutius Sextius, or Davide Surilie after Glarthir begins his “rampage” will no longer cause a quest update as though you killed them for Glarthir.</li>
<li>The Worm Anchorite at Dark Fissure was intended to repeat his ritual every time the Shade of the Revenant occurred, but NecroAnchoriteQuestScript was not resetting the variables properly.</li>
<li>The Worm Anchorite’s ritual will no longer progress if he is dead or in combat.</li>
<li>In MS40, instituted failsafes for if Melisande misses with her spell or the player leaves the Chamber of the Lost before the scene plays out.</li>
<li>In MS40, Melisande’s basement door will now lock as intended once she’s inside, and it will no longer trap the player inside if they follow her.</li>
<li>In “Necromancer’s Moon,” it was possible to begin the quest without receiving the appropriate rank increase to Conjurer. This would cause the player to eventually miss out on Master-Wizard rank.</li>
<li>In “Information at a Price,” speaking to Eridor would produce both a prompt about “Information” and “I have information for you”; “Information” is now available as a topic whereas “I have information for you” is a choice linked to his greeting.</li>
<li>In MG14Plot, speaking to J’skar before he forcegreets will no longer cause him to immediately start a conversation again.</li>
<li>In MG09Motives, speaking to Mercator Hosidus before he forcegreets will no longer cause him to immediately begin a conversation again.</li>
<li>In MS40, Hal-Liurz will now appropriately bring the Count to you again if you initially declined to help him, or if you quit the conversation before asking about your reward.</li>
<li>It was possible to progress in Hannibal Traven’s quests while expelled from the Mages Guild; created a new dialogue line to block conversation while expelled.</li>
<li>It was possible to progress in Raminus Polus’ Mages Guild quests if permanently expelled from the Mages Guild; created a new line to block conversation while permanently expelled (unless MS40 is at stage 5, where speaking to Raminus is necessary).</li>
<li>In MG13Information, it is no longer possible to send the vampire hunters to Bloodcrust Cavern if all the vampires are already dead.</li>
<li>In MS37, the Refined Frost Salts will now be added to Julienne Fanis’ inventory rather than her merchant chest, as her chest could respawn.</li>
<li>Corrected the quest targets in MS40: they will now properly direct you to Count Hassildor at stages 70 and 80 when necessary, instead of always pointing to Hal-Liurz.</li>
<li>Rona Hassildor is now essential until her part in MS40 is done.</li>
<li>Skingrad jailors were the only jailors without the “visit a prisoner” topic; created a new response for them using unused audio apparently intended for them.</li>
<li>Various Dark Brotherhood-related rumors were not checking that NPCs were in the appropriate locations before being used.</li>
<li>In MS37, Julienne Fanis could indicate that she was out of Refined Frost Salts when this was not the case.</li>
<li>Jailors had some greetings in the wrong order.</li>
<li>Guard greetings for when the player is jailed were not quitting the conversation as indicated.</li>
<li>Corrected some greetings from guards that were checking infamy using GetActorValue rather than GetPCInfamy.</li>
<li>Eridor will no longer use his branching MG13Information greetings once stage 50 has been reached, to be consistent with the other hunters.</li>
<li>Mages Guild members would refuse to speak to you if you wore necromancers’ robes, but strangely not if you wore the garb of their head honcho, the King of Worms’ robes.</li>
<li>J’skar will no longer use his MG14Plot hellos when in conversation with other NPCs before the quest officially begins.</li>
<li>Speaking to Eridor about “information” after telling him that the vampires were in Bloodcrust Cavern will no longer result in a blank dialogue screen with the only option being to exit the conversation (this was an engine failsafe when linked choices’ conditions weren’t valid; solved by creating new copy of the dialogue that will block the original until the linked choice’s conditions are valid).</li>
<li>Eridor will no longer offer the “information” topic once he has been convinced to leave (he would simply repeat himself and walk through being convinced to leave again).</li>
<li>Created new responses to the “information” topic to take into account whether the player told Eridor they were a concerned citizen or not (his default response assumed the player had said they were).</li>
<li>At the end of MG14Plot, Traven will automatically quit the conversation (he would block conversation if spoken to afterwards, and could only be asked about “tasks,” which would simply cause him to recommend speaking to Raminus about advancement).</li>
<li>Agronak’s dialogue topic about killing the Grand Champion was checking the wrong faction rank.</li>
<li>It is now necessary to choose MG11ChoiceHeretohelp when speaking to Tar-Meena during “Necromancer’s Moon,” as in MG11ChoiceBlackSoulgems her dialogue was written as though the player had selected that option.</li>
<li>It is now necessary to choose MG12TravenWhoInformant during “Liberation or Apprehension?”, as in MG12TravenGoOn Traven would continue as though he had told you the name of his informant already.</li>
<li>One of Eridor’s responses to MG13EridorWho was missing the “info refusal” check and was not appropriately linked to his usual cadre of dialogue choices.</li>
<li>One response to MG13EridorWhy was not appropriately filtered for telling Eridor that you were a concerned citizen, and the other did not appropriately link to the rest of Eridor’s dialogue options.</li>
<li>Eridor’s response to MG13Nevermind will no longer exit the conversation, so as to allow the player to raise Eridor’s disposition to learn who he was (if you said you weren’t from Skingrad) and to select the “information” topic.</li>
<li>Raminus’ responses in MGExpulsion01 and MGExpulsion02 for telling him that you had the ingredients he asked for, but not actually having them, was not checking the new variable the Unofficial Patch added to tally Bloodcrust and normal vampire dust.</li>
<li>Removed an erroneous linked dialogue from MS40Choice1A.</li>
<li>MS40Choice2A will now exit the conversation.</li>
<li>Declining to help Count Hassildor during MS40 will now exit the conversation as intended, and reset the variables necessary to ask Hal-Liurz to call him again.</li>
<li>MS45DarMaUntie will now exit the conversation, in order to prevent the result script from making Dar-Ma say an unsubtitled line.</li>
<li>One NQDSkingrad NPC-to-NPC conversation line that had no audio recorded for Redguards or Imperials will no longer be available to those races.</li>
<li>Corrected overly-restrictive conditions on Denel and Skaleel’s “Vahtacen” topic responses.</li>
<li>In MS40, refusing to help Count Hassildor will no longer cause him to repeat his entire story again. Instead he will skip right to asking if you’re willing to help.</li>
<li>It was possible for Ysabel Andronicus to tell you that she’d “already told you” how to challenge Agronak if the first time you spoke to her, you weren’t at Champion rank.</li>
<li>Corrected the quest targets in “Seeking Your Roots;” it will no longer point to Selena Orania at stage 10 if you are not in Bruma or if she is dead.</li>
<li>Corrected the quest targets in “Join the Mages Guild” to point to the guild heads at stage 10.</li>
<li>Corrected a greeting for Raminus Polus that could indicate that you had received recommendations from all the guild halls when you had not.</li>
<li>Leyawiin guards could not be asked where to find inns or services.</li>
<li>Mages Guild quest hellos were being blocked by MG00General’s higher priority; copied them into MG00General so that they can be heard.</li>
<li>Corrected Mariana Ancharia and Candice Corgine not having a response to the “bed” topic if you had already rented a room.</li>
<li>Rumors about Glarthir being killed by the guards before anyone was hurt could still be heard even if he had succeeded in killing someone.</li>
<li>During DAMalacath, Lord and Lady Drad were having their old items removed before their peasant clothing was added, causing them to walk around in their undergarments until they were unloaded and re-loaded.</li>
<li>In MG01Destruct, Adrienne Berene will not sleep while the quest is active; her other packages weren't active during the quest, so this one appears to have been missed. If she was asleep it would cause her conversation with Erthor to not play correctly.</li>
<li>DAMephala will no longer shut down when complete, as this caused the post-quest dialogue to not play.</li>
<li>In Dark05Assassinated, failing the quest will no longer leave the Languorwine Antidote stuck in your inventory.</li>
<li>The Mysterious Note will have its quest item flag removed after TG00FindThievesGuild, as it was possible to advance to the next quest without it being removed from your inventory.</li>
<li>In TG11Heist, failing the quest by attacking the Moth Priests prematurely will now remove the essential tags and quest item status of everyone who would've had it removed if the quest were completed the "normal" way, and the Gray Fox's plan, the Arrow of Extrication, the Sewers Key, and the Boots of Springheel Jak will no longer be quest items. Most importantly, the player can escape the Palace, as opposed to being stuck in the Library forever.</li>
<li>In TG11Heist, going upstairs but remaining undetected before collecting the Scroll was causing the Moth Priests to have their aggression raised to maximum; it will now be reset upon descending the stairs.</li>
<li>In TG11Heist, it was possible to leave without the Scroll because the door upstairs was being unlocked once it was placed on the table. Delayed the unlocking until the player picks up the Scroll.</li>
<li>In TG11Heist, being arrested while in the Palace now requires the player to resist arrest, as getting thrown into jail would break the quest since the player couldn't get back into the Palace.</li>
<li>In MG18KingofWorms, speaking to Mannimarco before he paralyzes you is no longer possible, as it caused him to stand around glaring at the player instead of turning hostile.</li>
<li>In MS08, corrected the conditions on various MSFIN greetings so that prematurely killing Aleron causes the quest to resolve as intended: Kurdan appears, attacks, and you can loot the key to escape from his corpse; also shifted Kurdan's arrival marker so that he doesn't appear within the player's view.</li>
<li>During the tutorial, attacking Renault, Baurus, or Glenroy was not making them hostile after a certain number of attempts as intended.</li>
<li>While fighting Agronak in the Arena, it was possible for him to be resurrected by his SetRestrained call if the player didn't approach him before killing him (for example, using ranged combat).</li>
<li>Ri'bassa was intended to speak to the player after Sheogorath's reenactment of the K'shara, but the conditions placed within his script were too narrow.</li>
<li>After killing Rufio, Lucien Lachance was not supposed to appear if the player slept in the Inn of Ill Omen.</li>
<li>In MS23, Ralsa's initial greeting was adding MS23Help as a topic instead of linking it as a choice.</li>
<li>In MG05A, Earana's quest-related greetings could become invalid by offering to acquire the book for Teekeeus before she had finished translating it.</li>
<li>In MS18, it was possible to receive the best reward for the quest even if a son died by reanimating them, due to the GetDeadCount checks in Valus' dialogue checking that the dead count was exactly one.</li>
<li>Speaking to Hides-His-Heart in Dark05Assassinated will set his aggression and disposition properly so that he cannot be yielded to, which would cause him to stand around instead of speaking to Motierre.</li>
<li>Corrected a number of Thieves Guild-related hellos that were meant for the player but could be spoken to any NPC.</li>
<li>Corrected missing random flags on PickpocketNoCrime and TrespassNoCrime responses.</li>
<li>Corrected an Unseen line that could never play due to an erroneous GetShouldAttack check.</li>
<li>Guilbert Jemane's "Right! We're off!" response to MS16Choice3A should not be available after he and his brother begin following; it was causing both the follow and waiting options to be available when he was spoken to while following, but only the following option to be available while he was waiting.</li>
<li>Corrected NQDChorrolResponses topics allowing either NPC in the conversation to continue it, resulting it some very odd conversations.</li>
<li>TGQuestTalk's TGGrayFox response for merchants did not allow alchemists and enchanters, the only merchant classes excluded, to say the line.</li>

<b>Placement, Layout and Ownership Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>000540D9, 000540DA: Beds in the Drunken Dragon Inn with no ownership.</li>

<li>0006C4A3: Pitcher embedded in a shelf.</li>
<li>00085332, 00085335, 0006C4B2: Floating objects in the Arch-Mage's quarters.</li>
<li>0005E05B, 0005E059, 0005E05A: Floating objects in the Praxographical Center.</li>
<li>0005C297: Floating book in the Mystic Archives.</li>
<li>00071F9B: Floating tree.</li>
<li>000c9fef: Rock sticking up through Kvatch bridge.</li>

<li>0009566B: Sconce embedded in a wall.</li>
<li>0003795A, 0003795B: Bones embedded in the floor.</li>
<li>0007207f: Adjusted collision barrier to prevent accessing an unplayable area in Kvatch.</li>
<li>000653e2: Adjusted collision barrier to prevent jumping outside of the playable area in Skingrad Castle Courtyard.</li>
<li>0008391c, 00085275: Desk and chair (and other clutter objects on the desk) that were floating.</li>
<li>01013332: Rock placed to cover landscape gap in Cheydinhal.</li>
<li>A cell door in Castle Skingrad’s dungeon (2D1F0) was unlocked and unowned.</li>
<li>S’drassa did not own the Tears (7BE4A, 7BE4B, 7BE4C, 7BE4D, and 7BE4E) he places in his display case.</li>
<li>Corrected a wooden support beam (57BCC) that was placed too high in Belletor’s Folly, as it did not touch the ground.</li>
<li>Corrected the ownership of two doors and two beds in Faregyl Inn: the door to S’jirra’s room (9775E) has been assigned her ownership, the basement bed (97760) has been assigned Abhuki’s ownership so that it is no longer free to sleep in, and the last bed (97708) and door (9775F) have been assigned to Alix Lencolia to comply with his new sleep package (see above).</li>
<li>One tablet in Vahtacen (49877) was missing its accompanying ambient light; placed a new copy of ARBlueAMB160 to rectify this.</li>
<li>Two undead in Vahtacen (4D445 and 4D446) could be altered to the player’s presence despite the path to them being blocked by a wall that could only be opened by stepping on a panel on the other side; they will now not appear until the player tries to snatch the Elven helm for the related quest (parented on MG10Summon01REF).</li>
<li>The Imperial Watchtower in the Arcane University was owned by the Mages Guild faction, allowing the player to take anything inside. It is now owned by the Imperial Watch, and is a public area, in order to comply with other Watch towers in the City.</li>
<li>Corrected the ownership of a bed (2F1A6) in Alberic Litte’s house; it was unowned, allowing the player to sleep in it.</li>
<li>The rent door in Two Sisters Lodge was unlocked even before the player rented a room.</li>
<li>Corrected the ownership of the door to Vandorallen Trebatius’ room (2EF78) in the upstairs of the Two Sisters Lodge; assigned to his ownership so that he can open it.</li>
<li>Corrected the Arch-Mage’s Quarters actually being owned by Master-Wizards of the Mages Guild.</li>
<li>Corrected the ownership of Count Hassildor’s throne (2D45D); though he never used it, this is for consistency with changes that have been made to the other rulers’ thrones.</li>
<li>Corrected the ownership of several beds and doors across the inns of Cyrodiil – the player is no longer able to sleep in beds that aren’t rented, and NPCs will no longer be locked out of their rooms.</li>
<li>Corrected a hallway end in Arkved’s Hall of Changes that was placed too close and too high compared to the rest of the hallway, exposing the empty void surrounding the dungeon pieces.</li>
<li>Corrected the right-hand bed and door ownership in the Grey Mare so that Gaturn gro-Gonk can use it as intended.</li>
<li>Corrected the ownership of Minerva's and the rent bed in the Inn of Ill Omen so that they can't be slept in (without paying, in the case of the rent bed).</li>
<li>Corrected the pathgrid in the Cheydinhal Mages Guild so that NPCs won't try to walk through the counter.</li>
</ul>

<b>Text & Subtitle Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Book 4 of the Wolf Queen series (SKLxMercantile2) incorrectly uses Iachesis in place of Celarus several times. Two other books confirm Celarus is the head of the Psijic Order in the 3rd Era, so this one is wrong.</li>
<li>Corrected the subtitle in Agronak gro-Malog’s greeting when returning from Crowhaven (“…the words of the Lord Lovidicus…” -> “…the words of Lord Lovidicus…”; “Ah, but I believe I owe you…” -> “Ah, I believe I owe you…”; "Hmm… Interesting…” -> “Hmm… Ah… Interesting…”).</li>

</ul>

<p class="h">v3.5.1 (2014-08-31)</p>
<b>UOP Changes</b>
<ul>
<li>The silver longsword, shortsword, and dagger textures, edited so long ago for having "black parts" was never actually a bug. The following files have been removed from the distribution to correct for this: Textures\Weapons\SilverLongsword.dds, Textures\Weapons\SilverLongsword_n.dds, Textures\Menus\Icons\Weapons\silverdagger.dds, Textures\Menus\Icons\Weapons\silverlongsword.dds, Textures\Menus\Icons\Weapons\SilverShortSword.dds, Textures\Menus50\Icons\Weapons\silverdagger.dds, Textures\Menus50\Icons\Weapons\silverlongsword.dds, Textures\Menus50\Icons\Weapons\SilverShortSword.dds, Textures\Menus80\Icons\Weapons\silverdagger.dds, Textures\Menus80\Icons\Weapons\silverlongsword.dds, Textures\Menus80\Icons\Weapons\SilverShortSword.dds</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest & Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>During “Paranoia,” Glarthir was intended to have a dialogue option for if the player had killed some, but not all, of the people he wanted killed. It is now appropriately linked.</li>
<li>Blocked off some guard greetings; these greetings, which were intended to be used when you first spoke to certain guards in certain locations, were either random or too low priority. They had been copied into NQDGuard by earlier UOP versions, but the original dialogues could sometimes slip through.</li>
<li>Weedum-Ja’s NQDKvatchNPC greetings were not consistent with the other refugees: she should always thank you for closing the gate after you have done so, and her “We’ve been hit bad, but we’ll come back.” greeting should only be said once.</li>
<li>Itius Hayn’s unique greeting is now no longer blocked by his “Imperial Corruption” greeting.</li>
<li>During charactergen, Uriel Septim will now use his long greeting (the one with multiple dialogue options) if the player is not in combat, and his usual short greeting if the player is, rather than these being random.</li>
<li>Mazoga’s post-MS92 greeting about finding black bows was being used at all times, not just when she was actually searching for them.</li>
<li>Corrected a large swath of Fighters Guild-related dialogue that should have been available after certain quests were done, but could never be heard because the quests would shut down beforehand.</li>
<li>Corrected some greetings from “A Brotherhood Betrayed” intended for after the quest but which could never be heard because the quest would shut down first.</li>
<li>Corrected some Mages Guild hellos that had bad conditions: they were intended to be used by Mages Guild members and also the mages in Fort Ontus, but the conditions broke the dialogues.</li>
<li>Corrected one Mages Guild hello that was checking the NPC’s rank compared to the player’s rank, even if the NPC wasn’t speaking to the player.</li>
<li>Lucien Lachance’s “I speak for the Night Mother.” hello will no longer block his other hellos.</li>
<li>Fixed one of Methredhel’s hellos in TG01BestThief being blocked by her other dialogue.</li>
<li>Corrected TG01MethredhelCheated having a blank “link from” list, preventing it from being said. Also removed the incorrect “SetStage” result script.</li>
<li>In “A Rat Problem,” Arvena Thelas will no longer blame you for killing her rats if you told her Quill-Weave had nothing to do with the situation (her dialogue never suggested she didn’t trust you, and it is more likely that this hello was intended for if all her rats were actually dead, which fails the quest).</li>
<li>Orrin’s hello and goodbye in TG07Lex were checking the wrong stages of the quest.</li>
<li>One Fighters Guild hello was meant for when NPCs greeted lower-ranked faction members, but it could also be used on the player even if the player wasn’t a member of the faction.</li>
<li>Corrected M’aiq’s unique goodbye being flagged as occurring randomly.</li>
<li>Corrected on Fighters Guild rumor that mentioned the Cheydinhal guildhall but was checking that the speaker wasn’t in Bruma rather than Cheydinhal.</li>
<li>One MS05 rumor did not add the “Kud-Ei” topic as the other did.</li>
<li>One incorrect rumor about Irene Metrick being good at jumping was meant to have been blocked off by an earlier UOP version, but the condition was incorrect and it could still be heard.</li>
<li>Corrected two Thieves Guild-related rumors that were meant to be said by Imperial City citizens but were instead said by everyone except those citizens.</li>
<li>M’aiq the Liar will no longer sometimes use generic rumors rather than his unique ones.</li>
<li>One TG07Lex attack line had no audio recorded for male Nords; the only male Nord NPC eligible to say this line, Heinrich Oaken-Hull, can no longer say it.</li>
<li>Corrected two generic detection lines never being heard because of erroneous GetShouldAttack checks.</li>
<li>Dro’shanji had no audio recorded for one dialogue topic in “The Fugitives”; he can now no longer say it.</li>
<li>Ley Marillin will no longer mention that Umbacano is looking for Ayleid artifacts if Umbacano’s quest has already been started.</li>
<li>A number of FGD04Defector lines for Modryn Oreyn were not available due to checking the wrong quest in the conditions.</li>
<li>Other NPCs will no longer query Francois Motierre about his own death.</li>
<li>Imperial males can no longer ask other NPCs about Faelian’s death, as they had no audio recorded for it.</li>
<li>Modryn Oreyn could be asked about “Chorrol” while MS18 was running, but strangely only between the hours of 12 PM and 12 AM.</li>
<li>Fixed Emfrid’s MS18-related “Chorrol” topic never being available due to wanting the quest to be completed first (clipped “…is down at the Grey Mare…” from the line because Emfrid is the owner of the Grey Mare and it just sounded odd to speak as though she wasn’t).</li>
<li>Corrected being unable to rent at the Tiber Septim Hotel while you had rented at the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn.</li>
<li>Dark Brotherhood members will no longer mention Antoinetta Marie in conversations if she’s dead.</li>
<li>During “The Assassinated Man,” choosing to remain silent did not exit the conversation as the other options did.</li>
<li>In “The Collector,” corrected a number of issues: firstly, selling statues as a stack would cause Umbacano to only receive one of the stack – he will now receive every statue you sell (assuming you don’t buy it back, of course); secondly, selling more than one statue prior to the quest could cause Umbacano to delay introducing “another task” and deprive you of the locations of several statues, and if you sold all the statues, a fame point. New lines have been created for Umbacano: now when you first meet him after receiving his letter, he will recognize how many statues you have sold and will immediately mark locations and/or tell you about “another task.”</li>
<li>In “May the Best Thief Win,” Methredhel will now complain to Armand if the diary was stolen from her.</li>
<li>In “Next of Kin,” Perennia Draconis will no longer give the player a copy of the gift list or the money to pay for the gifts if the player has stolen them beforehand.</li>
<li>During “The Hist,” Jeetum-Ze was meant to wait in his room during the assault on the Blackwood Headquarters, but lacked a package to keep him there.</li>
<li>Shum gro-Yarug, flagged essential to prevent his death by falling off the castle’s bridge by earlier UOP versions, will no longer be essential once “Lost Histories” is done and the Skingrad house has been purchased.</li>
<li>It was possible to finish MS05 without ever having the “Kud-Ei” topic added.</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Restored a line of dialogue in Eilonwy’s “Mages Guild” topic that had been cut much earlier when the line was initially corrected.</li>
<li>Shroob, never being happy with the original corrected audio for Alberic Litte’s “Mages Guild” topic, has changed the audio and text to “If you're skilled enough, Athragar has some rather powerful spells for sale. Very effective, but dangerous to the inexperienced.”</li>
<li>Corrected an MS14 rumor for female Imperials, where “turning” was read as “burning.”</li>
<li>Corrected an MS37 where S’drassa was referred to as a woman.</li>
<li>Corrected audio in MG05Fingers for Imperial males where “skulking” was read as “sulking.”</li>
<li>Corrected Mazoga saying that Black Brugo and his gang should be expected in Telepe on Middas when actually they appeared every night.</li>
</ul>

<b>NPC, Creature & AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Swamp Trolls, FGD06Troll01, and Savage Trolls will now have the leveled regeneration that was intended, rather than having no regeneration at all. This was due to the leveled spell lists they had no only misunderstanding how leveled spell lists work (the “level” listed is the NPC’s skill level in the spell’s skill, not the NPC’s level), but abilities cannot be added through leveled spell lists.</li>
<li>Viera Lerus should be level-offset like the other guard captains, rather than being a static level, which made her rather useless at higher levels during the defense of Bruma.</li>
<li>Corrected on Dremora Marknyaz being female – there is no audio recorded for female Dremora, so she was completely silent and suffered from the “I HAVE NO GREETING” bug.</li>
<li>Hagaer had a duplicate sleep package.</li>
<li>Ferul Ravel’s leveled spell list suggests that he was intended to be a sorcerer rather than a savant.</li>
<li>The Bruma Guards that accompanied Burd into the Bruma gate needed to have their class changed, as they were warriors yet wore light armor.</li>
<li>The Yellow Team Champion that you fight in the Arena now actually looks like the champion you see in the Bloodworks.</li>
<li>Mannimarco did not need low-level processing.</li>
<li>Alix Lencolia’s stats were completely out of line for a level 20 master trainer.</li>
<li>NPCs will no longer be trapped by the Arcane University’s gate: NPCs who merely visit the grounds will now remain outside the Mages Guild-only inner grounds, and the addition of a subspace and changed ownership on the doors from the lobby to the grounds ensures that NPCs who need to pass through will do so by going through the lobby. Also corrected the battlemage’s routines so that they don’t barge through the lobby at all hours.</li>
<li>Corrected on Mage Scholar’s routine so that he no longer ignores his lecture duty and his sleeping.</li>
<li>JesanSextiusPerformCountsArms needed to be a travel package rather than a wander, as he was no reliably sitting in his chair.</li>
<li>Corrected the UOP corrected to ArquenAmbush, which was accidentally breaking “Honor Thy Mother.”</li>
<li>Corrected the start time on HlidaraSleepChorrol23x7.</li>
<li>Apprentice2CastAlteration06x6 was causing the Apprentice using it to stall rather than cast spells because the spell chosen was expert-level and cost too much magicka for him at lower player levels.</li>
<li>Corrected bad conditions on Dark18ArquenFirstRitual.</li>
<li>Adamus Phillida will no longer stand beside the pond for two hours before actually swimming.</li>
<li>KvatchSoldier has had its Athletics skill dropped and its Sneak skill restored; this was because NPC attributes depend on their class skills, and dropping Sneak had an adverse effect: with no Agility increase, NPCs of this class were easier to stagger.</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Honorblade of Chorrol was not using its unique icon and mesh.</li>
<li>LL2NPCStaffLvl100 had the “calculate from all levels <= PC level” flag checked, causing this list to function identically to LL2NPCStaff100 (“100” is the chance of the NPC getting a staff, “Lvl” normally means that the NPC receives the best possible item for their level).</li>
</ul>

<b>Script Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected the timing on LucienLachanceHunted’s script so that he no longer turns invisible and takes off running halfway through his goodbye.</li>
<li>Arena combatants who are disarmed can now pick up their dropped weapons – the script that stopped the player from taking them after battle also prevented their original owners from picking them up.</li>
<li>Baurus was intended to shout at the Emperor’s assassin, but his calls to say his Attack line whenever he began combat were cutting the line short.</li>
<li>The detection in the scripts for the guests in “Whodunit?” will now actually work: as stated in the quest, getting caught offing someone will cause you to be outed as the murderer.</li>
<li>During “The Purification,” getting caught attacking the other assassins was supposed to turn any witnesses hostile; however, the writer failed to take into account that, because of the Dark Brotherhood faction’s huge per-rank disposition bonuses, a 70-point drop in disposition was not going to make the witnesses hostile.</li>
<li>A ModAv call in MG04Script was giving Caminalda “invincible” health – her health bar would not appear until you had beaten off the accidental 100-point hitpoint boost.</li>
<li>Mages in Fort Ontus will no longer switch to necromancer robes if they are dead.</li>
<li>If the player finished MS51 while in Countess Valga’s chambers, the quest would never shut down.</li>
<li>Corrected the UOP’s accidental breaking of innkeepers; though they had no reason to have low-level processing, without it, their scripts failed to work outside their cell. The necessary lines have been added to the trigger objects instead. This fix is not retroactive in certain situations, but affected innkeepers can be fixed by clicking on them in the console and typing “set cleanup to 2”.</li>
</ul>

<b>Spell & Ability Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>DarkGarlic should be draining Vicente’s strength and endurance rather than damaging it; NPCs can’t restore their attributes, so removing the spell if he no longer had garlic was rather pointless.</li>
<li>NPCAbsorbFatigue2Apprentice/3Journeyman/4Expert had such high magnitudes and durations that no NPC could cast them. Based on the progression of vanilla absorb health spells, the magnitudes are now set to 20, 40, and 80 respectively, with no duration.</li>
<li>The magnitude of NPCSilence2Apprentice was so high that it actually made it a journeyman-level spell, and cost far too much magicka for Illusion-using NPCs (rogues, bards, and agents, who have little magicka) to cast.</li>
<li>Even though the necromancer class had Alteration as a major skill, LL2Necromancer100, LL2NecromancerLvl100, MG17Necromancer100, and MG17NecromancerLvl100 did not include any Alteration spells, which was inconsistent with all other leveled spell lists, which assigned a spell for every school that the NPC had as a major skill.</li>
<li>LL0AbsorbSkillCombat/Magic/StealthMajor100 lacked divisions based on the caster’s skill level, the effect being that the list could assign an NPC a spell he or she had no hope of being able to cast.</li>
<li>LL2Sorcerer100 and LL2SorcererLvl100 were assigning Illusion spells to users rather than Mysticism, despite the sorcerer class having Mysticism as a major skill, and not Illusion.</li>
</ul>

<b>Placement, Layout and Ownership Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a locked door and the bed behind it in the Newlands Lodge lacking ownership.</li>
<li>Since Alberic Litte now sleeps at home, there is no reason for the double bed on the top floor of the Chorrol Mages Guild to be owned by him.</li>
<li>Two doors in the Surilie Brothers’ house needed to be owned by the GenericOwner faction to allow Glarthir to pass through them if the player refused to help him and he took matters into his own hands.</li>
<li>Faelian did not own the door to Lorkmir’s house; when he would give the player his key, he would be trapped outside.</li>
<li>A door in Toutius Sextius’ house needed to have its ownership changed to GenericOwner for the same reason the Surilie Brothers’ door was changed above.</li>
<li>The door to Countess Valga’s room was unowned; its ownership was changed to the ChorrolCastleFaction to avoid trapping Alessia Caro there on her monthly trip.</li>
<li>Countess Valga’s bed’s ownership has been set to the ChorrolCastleFaction to allow all three NPCs who are supposed to sleep there – Alessia, Hlidara Mothril, and the Countess – to access beds.</li>
<li>Bernadette Peneles’ bed was unowned; since her house is one cell, the player could sleep in it during Bernadette’s home owner open house.</li>
<li>One door in the upstairs of the West Weald Inn was unowned; it should be owned by Graklak gro-Buglump to allow him to access his room.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.5.0 (2014-06-30)</p>
<b>UOP Changes</b>
<ul>
<li>Distribution note: The EXE installer is no longer supported and will not be distributed to hosting sites from this point forward.</li>
<li>The COBL GenericLoreScript has been synchronized with the official COBL 1.73 update.</li>
<li>UOPAbAlchemyWizardry had the incorrect magnitude for the fortify Alchemy effect.</li>
<li>UOPGuardBowAOEScript will now handle Imperial Palace guards, who use silver bows and Imperial Palace shields.</li>
<li>UOPCarandialScript had incorrect syntax when checking if his horse was dead.</li>
<li>UOPChapelFriendsFixScript should exclude Tsavi, as the key it was adding had been added to her inventory on her base actor.</li>
<li>Agarmir has been flagged as essential to prevent breaking MS29 with his early death (previous UOP versions had done this, but it had been dummied out, apparently due to mod conflicts, but the scripting to remove his essential flag remained); UOPCleanupScript has been corrected to reflect this.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest & Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Kvatch topic Bongond uses bad conditions on it that caused it to never play.</li>
<li>A variety of generic dialogue responses, ranging from persuasion responses to recharging dialogue, were missing random flags, preventing them from ever being uttered.</li>
<li>Dark01KnifePost, containing reactions from Manheim and Minerva to Rufio’s death, never runs; it will now be begun by Ocheeva’s greeting at the end of Dark01Knife (which has also been cleaned up to correct some duplicated conditions).</li>
<li>One of Umbra’s greetings would only play at stage 20 of DAClavicusVile and onwards, which was inconsistent with her hellos and goodbyes, which would play from the start of the game. This means that she will no longer use an inappropriate generic greeting if spoken to before the quest.</li>
<li>Hannibal Traven had two greetings that would both disappear once “Information at a Price” was finished; since both of these lines had the same conditions, it seems logical that “Greetings, Magister. I trust you are serving the guild well” was meant to be said once MG13Information had completed.</li>
<li>Fathis Ules was supposed to cut off all attempts by non-Thieves Guild members to speak to him when he was in Chorrol at the end of MS16A, before he approaches the player to start MS16B, but an incorrect faction check prevented it from being used.</li>
<li>Speaking to the Gray Fox while wearing the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal would cause him to react like any other NPC; he now will use Corvus Umbranox’s unique reaction.</li>
<li>Sister Angrond and Sister Phebe Jeanard would give her unique greeting every time after speaking to her once, rather than the first time you spoke to her.</li>
<li>J’baana had several greetings in TrainingSecurity that went unused due to incorrect conditions.</li>
<li>NQDBruma greeting “I heard that you helped the Guard close that Oblivion Gate. Thanks. We were getting worried about that damn thing” could be spoken by Captain Burd, who was also in the gate with you.</li>
<li>If Martin was spoken to after saving Kvatch but before “Find the Heir” by a stage four vampire, he would revert to a standard Imperial male voice; he will now use a new greeting using audio from his unique hello in the Vampire quest.</li>
<li>One of Laythe Wavrick’s MS51 hellos was welcoming the player to Castle Chorrol’s Great Hall without checking if the player was actually in the great hall.</li>
<li>NPC vampires will no longer use the hellos in the Vampire quest mentioning how the player looks ill or should see a healer (they were already excluded from the vampire-related greetings).</li>
<li>Tivela Lythandas’ gender-specific hellos were checking her own sex rather than the player’s.</li>
<li>A variety of quest-related hellos could be said to other NPCs as well as the player, which created nonsensical situations like questgivers congratulating other people for the player’s accomplishments or inquiring about quest progress.</li>
<li>Many quest-related hellos and goodbyes had the default random flag left on them by mistake, resulting in these dialogues rarely, if ever, being heard.</li>
<li>The hellos and goodbyes intended for the Cheydinhal guards around the MS13 Oblivion gate could only be spoken by one type (there are three).</li>
<li>The fix for Ulrich Leland greeting his fellow Cheydinhal guards with sneers and death threats has been applied to his other MS10 hellos.</li>
<li>Mazoga always used her hello about hunting Black Bows because the conditions were incorrect; this has been corrected, and she will only use it when she is actually searching for them.</li>
<li>Arcane University apprentices and scholars will no longer try to begin their random academia-related discussions with NPCs who cannot respond correctly, such as guards or University honchos like Raminus Polus.</li>
<li>Goodbye “ABOVE HERE ARE RESPONSES TO LOW DISPOSITION GOODBYES” could accidentally be spoken by NPCs; it now features impossible conditions to prevent that.</li>
<li>J’skar’s MG13Plot goodbye for being outside the guildhall was checking the incorrect stage.</li>
<li>Raminus Polus had a goodbye intended for the player at the end of “Confront the King,” but it could never be heard because the quest would shut down beforehand. It has been moved to MG00General.</li>
<li>Aelwin Merowald’s post-“Go Fish” hellos and goodbyes could never be heard because the quest would shut down first; they have been duplicated into SQFIN.</li>
<li>One NPC-to-NPC low disposition goodbye has been flagged random end to prevent NPCs from using lines beneath it, which would prevent the GoodbyeVAR from being reset and in turn cause them to use them when speaking to the player.</li>
<li>One of Teekeeus’ goodbyes in MG05Fingers could never be heard because it was below his other goodbye for the quest.</li>
<li>Imperial males and Reguards had no audio recorded for the line “There’s a charge in the air. Been casting some Destruction spells?”; these races can no longer use this line.</li>
<li>Chanel had a hellos in MS51 greeting the player as a “fellow magician” but which identified the player as a mage by their class; the list included a number of NPC-only classes but did not include Nightblades and Healers, two default magic-specialized classes available to the player.</li>
<li>An Imperial City rumor about Adamus Phillida finally retiring was meant to be available during Dark09Retirement, but had impossible conditions.</li>
<li>A nobility rumor about visiting the Count of Bravil could be spoken by the Count himself or his son.</li>
<li>Leyawiin rumor “I hear the Count's got someone to sort out that business with Mazoga the so-called knight.” can no longer be spoken by Redguards, who had no audio recorded.</li>
<li>Hit “You… die!” could only be spoken by one of the Hackdirt Brethren rather than all of them.</li>
<li>A generic flee line meant for merchants could only be used by NPCs of the MerchTrader class; it has been corrected to allow any merchant NPC to say it (except Argonian, Khajiit, or Redguard NPCs, who had no audio recorded).</li>
<li>Various generic lines in Hackdirt were corrected to allow the villagers (who are now in the UOP-exclusive villagers faction) to use them instead of just the Brethren.</li>
<li>Emperor Uriel Septim could revert to a standard Imperial voice if he power attacked or yielded to the player, so new lines have been created for him using his other lines.</li>
<li>Gilen Norvalo and Grey-Throat had responses for the “Seridur” and “Vampire” topics that couldn’t be heard because the quest shut down before they could be accessed; they have been duplicated to MSFIN.</li>
<li>A generic question asking merchants how their business was going could only be asked to NPCs of the MerchTrader class; it can now be asked to any merchant NPC.</li>
<li>An Imperial City question asking if the other person had heard about Gaston Tussaud’s murder could only be spoken prior to that actually happening; it will now only be used afterwards.</li>
<li>Mages Guild members in Skingrad will no longer ask about Erthor’s whereabouts after the Skingrad recommendation is completed.</li>
<li>NPCs can no longer speak about Oblivion gates opening across Tamriel before this actually occurs, and will cease once the main quest is completed.</li>
<li>Felen Relas had a response to the Mages Guild topic meant for Mages Guild members that could never be heard because of incorrect conditions.</li>
<li>The last CreatureResponse was missing the script to reset the quest variable.</li>
<li>Dagail appears to have been intended to re-equip her father’s amulet once it was given to her, but no script to equip it was added despite a deliberate break in the conversation being scripted.</li>
<li>Imperial Legion soldiers will no longer vacillate between two responses to the Gray Fox topic, one of which made no sense as it was intended for guards outside of the Imperial City.</li>
<li>Varulae had a greeting and hello meant for use after completing her quest, but the quest would always shut down before they could be heard; they have been moved to MSMisc and will play from the end of “The Ghost Ship of Anvil” onward.</li>
<li>Ja'fazir's NQDLeyawiin greeting does not add the JihattTopic even though he uses the word in dialogue.</li>
<li>Alves Uvenim's daedric shrines topic was incorrectly adding the two topics for Blackwood Company specific subjects.</li>
<li>Janus Hassildor has two additional topics during the Cure For Vampirism quest (MS40) that were never linked. Both of these should now be available when he tells you to go look for Melisande.</li>
<li>Bralsa Andaren was meant to shoo the player away while she was hunting deer and her training quest had not advanced far enough.</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Olfand incorrectly called his store North Winds in his greeting.</li>
<li>Boderi Farano would say that Dovyn Aren was the only other trainer in magic in the Imperial City when the master trainer of Illusion, Martina Floria, was one of her colleagues at the University.</li>
<li>Orintur would incorrectly indicate that Trayvond sold the strongest Shield spell outside the Arcane University when in actuality Orintur sold powerful Alteration spells – including the strongest default Shield spell – while Trayvond only sold Novice and Apprentice-level spells.</li>
<li>Claude Maric would tell the player that Malada was in the west of Cyrodiil when actually it was in the east; the line has been clipped to avoid him saying that it’s to the west.</li>
<li>NPCs in Leyawiin would erroneously call Dagail a man when discussing her (Imperial male audio was correct already).</li>
<li>Jorundr mentions that “once the Count makes a ruling, there's no way it's changing” but Bruma is ruled by the single, female Narina Carvain.</li>
</ul>

<b>NPC, Creature & AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Alga's random wander packages were checking that GetRandomPercent equaled 50 exactly, which made them unlikely to run.</li>
<li>Newheim the Portly is supposed to eat at Counts Arms at noon every day but his harbor wander package blocks this.</li>
<li>Ra'jiradh should visit the Arboretum on Tirdas and Turdas but his wander package at the Black Horse Courier office overrides this. His eat package is also partially blocked by the same wander package, resulting in strange behavior.</li>
<li>Regner is supposed to eat for 2 hours at the Jerall View Inn but his chair sitting package blocks this.</li>
<li>AI Pack TG11DarelothBasementMWF22x8 had to be split in two due to the crossing midnight bug. This will prevent Methredhel from running the schedule on the wrong days and messing up the remainder of her routine.</li>
<li>Deetsan now trains Illusion and Hil the Tall trains Alteration to mesh with what NPC dialogue says about them.</li>
<li>More NPCs have been flagged as having no low-level processing.</li>
<li>Ohtimbar bizarrely had 0 for his confidence, responsibility, and aggression, which could cause him to pilfer food from the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn. He has been given the usual 50/50/5.</li>
<li>Corrected two Leyawiin Guards using steel bows rather than fine steel bows as every other guard did.</li>
<li>Marinus Catiotus’ Anvil trip packages were below his sleep package in his AI list, causing him to travel back and forth between Anvil and the Imperial City on certain days of the month.</li>
<li>Tertius Favonius took trips to Bravil but was not a member of that town’s faction.</li>
<li>Algot’s Bruma curfew package for MQ13 was too low in his package list.</li>
<li>Renee Geonette will no longer stalk her husband everywhere, even on his trip to Bruma.</li>
<li>Marana Rian’s trip to Bravil has been reinstated.</li>
<li>Ra’jhan was missing his UOP-specific trip package.</li>
<li>Tandilwe had no reason to be essential, as her script would already fail her master training quest if she was killed.</li>
<li>Tertius Favonius’ visit to Bravil had no duration; it has been set to a duration of 24 hours and he has been given a new UOP-specific package to handle the trip continuing past midnight.</li>
<li>It was not necessary for Wumeek to have two AI packages for visiting Weebam-Na – the original package merely needed to have an “AND” changed to an “OR”; in addition, his Leyawiin trip had no duration – it has been arbitrarily given a length of 24 hours.</li>
<li>There was no reason for Mach-Na to be essential.</li>
<li>As Orintur and Eilonwy now sleep in Willow Bank, Deetsan and Trayvond the Redguard no longer need to sleep in the basement.</li>
<li>Vampire Healers are now called by their proper names rather than being called “Vampire Sorcerer.”</li>
<li>Mahei’s package to stay near his wife will no longer overshadow all of his other AI packages.</li>
<li>Margarte had a package intended for merchants that would cause her to stay stock still in her house whenever she was home; this has been removed.</li>
<li>GoganGuard and MaelonaGuard now actually look like the normal Gogan and Maelona.</li>
<li>The Imperial Palace guards outside the Palace will now carry silver bows as their fellows do inside.</li>
<li>Imperial Palace guards no longer carry two shirts and two pairs of pants due to duplicated leveled lists.</li>
<li>Dark Brotherhood Murderers will no longer abandon their entire schedule and no longer offer services if one of them is taken as a follower.</li>
<li>DAAzuraVampire01 accidentally had his facegen settings changed when his accidental sex change was corrected by a previous UOP version; it has been reverted to vanilla.</li>
<li>Hears-Voices-In-The-Air and Sings-Like-Thunder will now no longer have a chance of spawning in various stages of undress because they were clothed using leveled lists that had a 25% chance of producing nothing.</li>
<li>Ida Vlinorman’s package to visit the Arena has been removed because it both was under her Chorrol visit AI and so could not be accessed, and because it would destroy her Chorrol trip by making her return to the Imperial City prematurely.</li>
<li>Corrected various follow, ambush, and find packages that were looking for the player’s base object rather than reference.</li>
<li>Dralora Athram was intended to meet with Dynari Amnis if “Misdirection” wasn’t active, but the packages’ conditions were incorrect.</li>
<li>UsheejaVisitWumeekFri18x4 was set to run on Saturday.</li>
<li>PistaMarillinVisitLeyawiin was missing the “must reach location” flag like other traveling NPCs’ packages.</li>
<li>Various wander packages that were set to “in cell” rather than a specific location have been corrected.</li>
<li>AncusAfaniusVisitCheydinhalCastle had its time parameters radically changed – the other two bards appear to have been intended to visit during dinner, but Count Indarys eats in an off-limits area, so Ancus will now visit the Count during his public court instead.</li>
<li>Similarly, AlgotVisitBrumaCastle had to be edited for the same reasons.</li>
<li>IreneMetrickVisitBrumaDay wasn’t taking into account that Irene visited the city for multiple days.</li>
<li>Corrected various Chorrol guard AI packages; they will no longer stop their patrol to meander around the Great Oak, and one day patrol guard will no longer have a muddled patrol.</li>
<li>LeyawiinCongregationSundayWorship was attempting to find Mysticism spells around the altar rather than (presumably) activating the altar for a blessing.</li>
<li>LeyawiinCastleDinnerWithCountess has been set to run when and where the Countess actually has dinner, and will no longer run during DASanguine.</li>
<li>Mahei will no longer try to remain near his wife if she is dead.</li>
<li>FGC06Elidor/Rienna/BragWander were set to “find” rather than “wander”.</li>
<li>MargarteCollectIngredients had Margarte search the countryside for ranged weaponry rather than ingredients.</li>
<li>Jee-Tah will no longer appear behind Maglir in Anvil on rare occasions because FGD04JeeTahFollow was only checking if FGD04Defector was running, not started.</li>
<li>TG07LarthjarApproachDoor had an invalid target check; it was supposed to be checking the player’s distance to him, so that he could approach the cell door.</li>
<li>Othrelos was abandoning his Skingrad trip early because OthrelosVisitSkingradUOP2 was set to run on the 7th rather than the 8th.</li>
<li>Janus Hassildor will now be marked as "Count Janus Hassildor" which is consistent with all of the other city rulers.</li>
<li>aaaSleep14x6 had no time parameters set, so any NPCs using it would sleep 24/7.</li>
<li>If Ocato is knocked out just before being moved to the Temple of the One, he will glitch into a ghost-like state and never recover.</li>
<li>AI pack aaaDefaultExploreEditorLoc3000 was incorrectly flagged to skip fallout behavior, which is inconsistent with all other default explore packs.</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>ChestVendorPawnbrokerLow02 had an invalid count of arrows and bear pelts which could result in both becoming infinite (-20 and -5 instead of 20 and 5).</li>
<li>Agarmir’s Debaser had the appearance and size of a shortsword but had the attack power, range, and weight of a longsword.</li>
</ul>

<b>Mesh & Texture Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Upper floor collision on LeyawiinHouseInteriorUpper09 was incomplete allowing you to walk through the railing. (Meshes\Architecture\Leyawiin\LeyawiinHouseInteriorUpper09.NIF)</li>
<li>The default icons for sigil stones had incorrect alpha channel setups. (Textures\Menus\Icons\IconSigilStone.dds, Textures\Menus50\Icons\IconSigilStone.dds, Textures\Menus80\Icons\IconSigilStone.dds)</li>
<li>farmhouse01.nif and farmhouse01snow.nif - Reworked the UV on the stone walls so that the textured window frame now actually fits over the window - also made some adjustments to remove black lines/bad seams from the thatch on farmhouse01.nif.</li>
<li>FarmHouseInterior01.NIF - Reworked UV on the stone wall so that the textured windows actually line up, closed up some open faces in the woodwork around the door and corrected the UV for the door posts.</li>
<li>SKHouseUpperInt06.NIF - Fixed the UV for the roof beams, moved a few faces in the underside of the first and second floor to the correct Tri-shape, corrected UV there also.</li>
<li>CheydinhalHouseMiddle03Interior.NIF - Corrected the forge to use the correct texture ( was previously using the same one as the fireplace), also corrected the UV for the fireplace to remove tears in the texture.</li>
<li>CheydinhalHouseMiddle01.NIF, CheydinhalHouseMiddle02.NIF, CheydinhalHouseMiddle03.NIF, CheydinhalHouseMiddle04.NIF, CheydinhalHouseMiddle05.NIF, CheydinhalHouseMiddle06.NIF - Fixed lots of missaligned UV's on the stone parts of the walls, redid all the UV's for the stairs to make them tile correctly without distorting too badly, also closed up some gaps in the wooden frams and corrected a few of the worst UV errors in the woodwork.</li>
</ul>

<b>Script Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>MS08UrsanneLocheScript was intended to fail MS08 if Ursanne died, but the script had an improper if/endif block.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<b>Text & Subtitle Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected Silverhome on the Water being called “Silverhome-on-the-Water” in NPC dialogue and quest and book text.</li>
<li>Topic TG09accept: "Sound's lucrative. I'll do it." -> "Sounds lucrative. I'll do it."</li>
<li>TG11 Stage 100 Log: "Even through they are blind" -> "Even though they are blind"</li>
<li>GottlesfontPrioryTopic: "... and you're welcome to gather mushrooms nearby." -> "...and you're welcome to gather mushrooms and leaves nearby."</li>
<li>ClutterBravilShop03: "When your mother-in-law comes to visit, put her up at Silverhome-on-the-Water." -> "When your mother-in-law comes to visit, put her up at Silverhome on the Water."</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.4.5 - Minor update (2013-12-31)</p>
<ul>
<li>Bleak Mine had silver veins but Lord Drad's dialogue explicity calls it a gold mine in spoken dialogue.</li>
<li>The door to The Old Way used for The Ultimate Heist (TG11) will now have a script change to block activation before the proper stage and the command to unlock it will be removed from the quest script as it appears the door will relock itself if the player does not get there before the cells reset.</li>
<li>EnchGlassWarAxeSoulTrap was unintentionally added twice to the LL0NPCWeapon0MagicWaraxe100 leveled list.</li>
<li>The 4 special frost atronachs in Frostfire Glade did not have the blood spray fix applied and lacked combat styles. (MS37CreatureFrostAtronach01Ling, MS37CreatureFrostAtronach02Guard, MS37CreatureFrostAtronach03Warden, MS37CreatureFrostAtronach04Lord)</li>
<li>Jauffre did not use the bed in his room at Cloud Ruler because JauffreCloudRulerSleep was not targeting the bedroll as it should have been.</li>
<li>Langley's sleep package (UOPLangleySleep0x6) did not flag him to remove his armor and weapons before getting into bed.</li>
<li>The unused UOPMQ11Allies class has been removed and the documentation adjusted to reflect that the changes were actually made on the KvatchSoldier class.</li>
<li>The fix for Ulrich Leland's dialogue was not handled correctly since MQ11 is checking to make sure Corruption and Conscience (MS10) has not started when adding him to the MQ13Allies Faction. Ulrich will now be taken out of this faction if MS10 is at stage 10 or higher and will not be checking to see if he's died.</li>
<li>The fix for MSShadowscale does not need to be running a background process since the quest's own script doesn't terminate when Teinaava dies and it hasn't been finished yet. The fix script will only deal with making sure Scar-Tail is marked non-essential.</li>
<li>Sanguine's Daedric quest (DASanguine) did not terminate with the fixed end stage provided by the UOP. This resulted in an endless processing of the final function to correct Alessia Caro's inventory for Adharji's Thieves Guild quest. It also had the unfortunate side effect of clobbering Caro's improved AI as this final function also contains an EVP statement that will repeat over and over. A variable has been inserted that will stop processing this function after the first time.</li>
<li>The White Gold Tower is not visible from the entrance of the Talos Plaza District (coming from outside the city) and has been nudged slightly to the west so it will be within the normal 5x5 loading area.</li>
<li>0005d182, 0005d16c: Floating trees in Kvatch.</li>
<li>000cb2a4: Floating debris pile in Kvatch.</li>
<li>0004cb49: Column detached from the cave wall in Underpall Cave.</li>
<li>00083e47: Column detached from the cave wall in Smoke Hole Cave.</li>
<li>00083fa5: Door in Smoke Hole Cave that should have been closed instead of open by default.</li>
<li>00070568: Downscaled and shifted a havok root that was jammed in the ceiling of Plundered Mine.</li>
<li>000a8510: Removed an overlapping cave piece in Shadows Rest Cavern.</li>
<li>0005e71c, 0005e17a, 0005e17b, 0005e738: Roots floating in mid-air in Fatback Cave.</li>
<li>0005b961: Upside down root in Veyond Cave.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.4.4 - Minor update (2013-06-30)</p>
<ul>
<li>The script to block the poison apple effect that was fixed in UOP 3.4.0 would incorrectly remove the damage spell when an NPC unloaded from memory but wasn't dead yet.</li>
<li>Four Ayleid wall pieces at Veyond needed to be lowered due to overlapping textures brought on by the Ayleid tileset fixes.</li>
<li>When starting The Bloodworm Helm (MG15Helm) Irlav Jarol will vanish right in front of you after Traven tells you he stole the helm. Irlav will now be disabled when J'Skar gives you the information in MG14Plot.</li>
<li>Captain Renault's katana hanging in Cloud Ruler Temple was mistakenly labeled as "Renote's Akaviri Katana"</li>
<li>The cost of training sessions was being calculated from your modified skill level instead of your base skill level. This fix requires OBSE v20 or higher to function. (obse_training_fix.dll file)</li>
<li>GoblinTribeShamanC had a base magic skill setting of 255 which should be 54 like the other goblin shamans, otherwise she can case all her spells for free.</li>
<li>Erandur-Vangaril should have had his level offset value set to 1 instead of 24 when he was given the PCLevelOffset flag in a previous fix.</li>
<li>SerpentsTrailOgre had stats indicating it was supposed to be an enhanced version of regular ogres but was accidentally configured to be insanely overpowered.</li>
<li>SummonAtronachFlame has the AbdaedricResistWeak ability, which no other atronach has.</li>
<li>SummonAtronachStorm lacks the AbAtronachShockResist ability like regular storm atronachs, and thus is not immune to shock.</li>
<li>0003056e: Bed should be owned by the Best Goods & Guarantees faction instead of Gundalas specifically, otherwise his wife can't use it.</li>
<li>0003ca48: Bed with only one access point, the second NPC can't use it.</li>
<li>0005a8f8: Bed should be owned by the MaheiFamilyFaction so both NPCs can use it.</li>
<li>0001ba2f: Bed should be owned by the GoganandMaelonaFaction so both NPCs can use it.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.4.3 - Minor update (2012-12-31)</p>
<ul>
<li>Some floating chests in the Skingrad Barracks have been grounded. (0002ED46,0002ED47,0002ED48,0002ED49,0002ED4A)</li>
<li>A banner was clipping through the wall in the Skingrad Barracks. (0003E784)</li>
<li>A tapestry in the Skingrad Barracks was clipping through a wall on the lower level. (0002ED7C)</li>
<li>A tapestry in the Chorrol Barracks was clipping through a wall on the lower level. (00086E7A)</li>
<li>Upon Agarmir's death, the player is incorrectly set to be removed from the MS29AgarmirFaction even though they were never added, which will result in the player being added due to a bug in the SetFactionRank command. Not retroactive as this is not important considering Agarmir will be dead by this point.</li>
<li>An Ayleid column in Garlas Agea and the objects stacked on top were floating above the ground. (00081871,00081872,00081873)</li>
<li>An Ayleid altar and the chest on top of it were floating above the ground in Hame. (0041D4C,0008508D)</li>
<li>An Ayleid column in Nonungalo and the objects stacked on top were floating above the ground. (000A0DE8,000A0DE7)</li>
<li>Calindil had an extra sleep package which was useless and has been removed.</li>
<li>A chest in Moranda03 was sitting outside the playable area and has been dragged in where it can be accessed. (00051870)</li>
<li>It should no longer be possible to jump from the Chorrol chapel to the city walls.</li>
<li>It should no longer be possible to jump from Newheim the Portly's house to the city walls in Anvil.</li>
<li>AI pack Dark06AtraenaWanderLobby has been adjusted to start at 2pm and last 6 hours so that Atraena's schedule will work properly.</li>
<li>Summoned Xivalai (SummonXivilai) have no fatigue. This has been corrected to 300, based on normal ones being 15xLevel and summoned ones being static level 20.</li>
<li>It was possible to speak to Audens Avidius and have him direct you to either Hieronymus Lex or Servatius Quintilius even if you were already investigating him and he was going to be arrested. This was due to his dialogue checking stage 90 instead of 91.</li>
<li>Irlav Jarol has a second line of dialogue in the Imperial City topic that could never play because his first one lacked a proper disposition check.</li>
<li>Jensine will now go to the Tiber Septim Hotel to eat on weekends since otherwise she just stays in her shop from 8pm to midnight on weekends due to her normal eat package only operating on weekdays.</li>
<li>Adamus Phillida's bodyguard could still turn angry and attack you even if you killed Phillida without being detected, such as with a poisoned apple.</li>
<li>Agarmir's shovel will no longer remain a quest item if the quest terminates due to having killed a participant before the mausoleum scene.</li>
<li>Tierra is supposed to stay with Savlian Matius in the Kvatch Castle Great Hall but AI pack MS48TierraReturnToKvatch lacked a condition check to keep her from doing so.</li>
<li>If you do quest TG06Atonement while also doing quest MG09Motives, the OnDeath block for MercatorHosidusScript was modified by the UOP so you would not get a blood price for killing Mercator. However, it checks a variable that gets changed quickly as the battle occurs.</li>
<li>In Corruption and Conscience (MS10, the bug ridden mess that never dies) it is possible to still hear Garrus comment about how you spoke to Llevana even if you were already past that point in the quest. A missing stage check on the dialogue conditions has been added.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.4.2 - Minor update (2012-07-27)</p>
<ul>
<li>Manheim Maulhand had no pants. Added LowerPants01 to his inventory.</li>
<li>Three dialogue lines meant to be spoken by palace guards during TG11 had the wrong class conditions on them, causing them to never be used. (18AE75, 18AE76 and 18AE77)</li>
<li>A fix for Vicente Valtiere's greeting in the Dark Brotherhood for Dark05AsassinatedFIN was broken when the conditions were changed. The greeting was no longer possible to deliver.</li>
<li>A collision box added to Vahtacen appears to serve no purpose and has been removed.</li>
<li>Magic ability AbArenaAgronak had an incorrectly set block fortification as well as two fire damage settings that didn't work. These have been corrected.</li>
<li>Changes made in UOP 3.0.0 to fix stolen item counting in Hackdirt put the townspeople into a new faction. This led to the greeting that adds the Hackdirt topic being blocked since the conditions still expected the NPCs to be in the Hackdirt Brethren faction.</li>
<li>Several Ayleid ruin meshes have had work done to help plug gaps, seams, and other problems.</li>
<li>Rosentia Gallenus' upstairs door will now unlock when the player accepts the Staff of the Everscamp so the scamps won't be trapped upstairs after her AI pack was corrected.</li>
<li>The white horse at Anvil (CREA 0001F11B) did not have the script attached to correct the animation glitch caused when trying to mount while seated.</li>
<li>SmokeHoleCave02 had a chest that was sitting outside the playable area (00083F68).</li>
<li>In ToadStoolHollow02 4 spawn points were sitting above the playable area (000973CD, 000973CE, 000973CF, and 000973D2).</li>
<li>The ShamanHelmet3.dds file which was corrected in a previous version has been updated to fix a corrupted alpha channel in the texture.</li>
<li>AI pack AlbericLitteSleep will send him to sleep at home, with his wife, instead of at the Mages Guild where there aren't enough beds for all the NPCs. Their bed is also now flagged as owned by the family since it had no owner set.</li>
<li>One of the downstairs beds in the Anvil Fighters Guild (0004F8DA) is incorrectly marked as owned by Azzan. The correct bed he should own (0004F91A) is the one his AI pack is currently targeting on the Dining Room level.</li>
<li>The inn fix for the Tiber Septim Hotel rent bug was incorrectly assigned the script for Five Claws Lodge in Leyawiin.</li>
<li>The inn fix for the Silverhome on the Water rent bug was incorrectly assigned the script for the Lonely Suitor.</li>
<li>The Bloated Float had not received a fix script for its rent bug.</li>
<li>Garrus Darelliun was delivering his greeting about news of Ulrich to every NPC in sight instead of just to the player as expected. The same was true of two other greetings about Ulrich, and 4 goodbye topics for the same quest. (Will this nightmare never end?)</li>
<li>Othrelos has had one of the defunct ImpEx packages removed from his AI schedule.</li>
<li>Several wander AI packages have been corrected to use a reference target rather than the "in cell" target because "in cell" wander targets cause NPCs to stand still in one spot rather than move around as they should.</li>
<li>Quill Weave will be removed from high priority AI processing when "A Rat Problem" is completed.</li>
<li>All of the master skill training quests will be stopped if the trainers are killed so their scripts will no longer get processed. Previously only the block traning was being stopped, the others got missed during this fix. The vanilla game would only mark then as completed, which doesn't stop the scripts.</li>
<li>cheydinhalceiling01_n.dds is an invalid greyscale normal map. Ethatron has provided a corrected version.</li>
<li>An iron longsword (0003794D) was sitting below the floor in the Arena Bloodworks.</li>
<li>The ChorrolArena cell was missing a tower which is visible in the additions made to the ArenaMatch cell.</li>
<li>A rock (000E0025) was embedded inside a tree in cell -47,-7 outside of Anvil.</li>
<li>Two stone bricks (00090F37, 00090F35) in LeyawiinCastleEntrance were embedded in the ground/wall where they couldn't be reached.</li>
<li>Corrected icons for the silver longsword, dagger, and shortsword have been provided by hexaae.</li>
<li>Animation glitches in the Xivilai fastforward.kf, handtohandfastforward.kf, and twohandfastforward.kf files have been corrected thanks to Koniption.</li>
<li>Meshes\Architecture\Tent\TentRoof01.NIF was in the wrong folder. It has been moved to Meshes\Architecture\Tents\ where it belongs, so that the fix will actually take effect instead of being ignored by the game.</li>
<li>The collision meshes on the Talos bridge that were added to keep NPCs from falling through were lowered slightly to keep them from becoming stuck on the edges instead.</li>
<li>The Clanfear and Daedroth skeleton fixes have been updated to retain compatibility with mods depending on them.</li>
<li>The following 3 files will need to be deleted if they were installed by the UOP:
 <ul>
  <li>Meshes\Creatures\Daedroth\Daedroth.NIF</li>
  <li>Meshes\Creatures\Clannfear\Head.NIF</li>
  <li>Meshes\Creatures\Clannfear\Clannfear.NIF</li>
 </ul>
(If you installed with BAIN, this should anneal out automatically)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.4.1 - Minor update (2011-12-01)</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed a few changes from the UOPS (Supplementals) ESP: Maran Rian's visit to Bravil, Anglamo's visit to Chanel, change to Alval Uvani's stats, change of Reach value of the chargen Goblin Staff.</li>
<li>Fixed introduced bug where the player couldn't buy Benirus Manor (Anvil) from Velwyn Benirus without hearing about it from townspeople first as the Manor topic wasn't added.</li>
<li>Added a check to the Ultimate Heist palace guard fix so the guards won't be missing in case the player unwisely decides to leave after using the Arrow of Extrication (which already ends the questline of course).</li>
<li>After the Lifting the Vale quest, Tolgan (Bruma) will no longer dismiss the player's conversation for no apparent reason.</li>
<li>The Havok collision on eight exterior fort ruin pieces RFCastleWallsBase01-08.NIF now fits the meshes properly.</li>
<li>Improved the fix for the Base Ring of Alchemy, Ring of Alchemy and Grand Ring of Alchemy so that their Fortify Alchemy effect doesn't appear twice or duplicate with fixes for the actual effect</li>
<li>Capitalized "door" in "Mages Guild door" in the Leyawiin guild.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.4.0 (2011-11-06)</p>
<b>UOP Changes/Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Added Bash tag C.Music, removed C.Water and updated tags in the ESP for version 2.79 and higher of Bash.</li>
<li>Updated the UOP installer to Inno Setup v5.4.2.</li>
<li>Removed renaming of "Silver Glass" item to "Silver Cup"; the latter may be more accurate but the former was unknowingly present in dialogue.</li>
<li>Reverted unexplained replacement of an invisible light source with an (unattached) hanging lamp in Kvatch's ruined Chapel of Akatosh.</li>
<li>Removed unneeded/unused dialog/LIP files MS18_ServiceRefusal_00004674_1.</li>
<li>Reverted changes to the enchantment magnitude of the Battle Axe of Jinxing and War Axe of Enfeeblement (UOPS), and the capacity of Claymore of Curses.</li>
<li>Moved the following UOPS changes into a separate ESP ( UOPS Additional Changes.esp ) so that they are still available at player discretion:
 <ul>
  <li>Undocumented change to magic stats. of Alval Uvani</li>
  <li>Angalmo's visits to Chanel at Chorrol Castle (had never been assigned this package, needed conditions changed to only do so after Canvas the Castle and/or be added to the castle faction, or else he would get stuck inside the castle)</li>
  <li>Marana Rian's visits to Bravil, essential status (had never been assigned the visit packages; was made essential as she is a master trainer so wouldn't die in the wilderness and be unable to train. Did not seem in keeping with her character as she is reasonably well-off and extols the Temple District as a place to live, yet visits filthy Bravil without the excuse of friends, relatives or a skooma addiction. Also split her visit package for the separate plug-in to avoid the crossing-midnight bug)</li>
  <li>A line of dialog for Marana Rian in the training quest: "Well, there it is..." (this is when she agrees to train the player, so was being made non-essential at this point)</li>
  <li>Undoing of UOP changes to the enchantments on the Battle Axe of Jinxing and War Axe of Enfeeblement (enchantment was determined for the UOP to be too large for the progression of the series and was switched to the next smaller one)</li>
  <li>Change of Reach value of the tutorial dungeon Goblin staff to one from zero (other zero-reach staffs were similarly changed in the UOPS but this appears to have been undone as of 3.3.7)</li>
  <li>AI package ChorrolChatChapelSteps20x4 (was fixed though it is not used by any NPC)</li>
  <li>Battle Axe of Enfeeblement added to leveled list LL0LootWeapon0Magic4Dwarven100 (was already one with a similar effect there)</li>
  <li>Tempest (shock-damage ebony claymore) added to leveled list LL0LootWeapon0Magic7Ebony100 (was already one with a similar effect there)</li>
  <li>Dagger of Weakness, Battle Axe of Weakness, and Immolator (fire damage elven claymore) added to leveled list LL0LootWeapon0Magic5Elven100 (these weapons are still available from dead NPCs so were not omitted from the game)</li>
  <li>Battle Axe of Diminishing and Dagger of Diminishing added to leveled list LL0LootWeapon0Magic2Steel100 (these weapons are still available from dead NPCs so were not omitted from the game)</li>
  <li>Warhammer of Strain added to leveled list LL0NPCWeapon0MagicWarhammer100 (this weapon is still available from loot containers and merchants so was not omitted from the game)</li>
  <li>War Axe of Sapping added to leveled lists LL0NPCWeapon0MagicWaraxe100 and LL0NPCWeapon0MagicWaraxeLvl100 (these weapons are still available from dead NPCs and loot chests so were not omitted from the game)</li>
  <li>Warhammer of Strain and Warhammer of Sapping added to leveled list LL0NPCWeapon0MagicWarhammerLvl100 (these weapons are still available from dead NPCs and loot chests so were not omitted from the game)</li>
  <li>Immolator (fire damage elven claymore) and Tempest (shock-damage ebony claymore) added to leveled lists FGNPCWeapon0MagicClaymoreLvl100 and SQ02LL0NPCWeapon0MagicClaymoreLvl100 (already ones with similar effects there)</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics / Crash Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The player will no longer be able to mount a horse while already sitting on something else, causing instant critical graphic unplayability requiring a reload, and possibly crashing Oblivion to desktop.</li>
<li>(Partially) fixed crash to desktop if the Everscamps that follow the player if the Whom Gods Annoy quest is running die in an Ayleid poison gas trap (made them immune to poison; will still crash on resurrection if something else kills them in the gas. This is all that could be done without noticeably changing them or using bad solutions such as PlaceAtMe).</li>
<li>Fixed stacking bug exploit whereby the player could create unlimited numbers of Black Soul Gems at necromancer altars without consuming Grand Soul Gems if player-filled ones were used (unavoidable side effect is that player-filled unconverted Grand Soul Gems in the altar will become empty, but the souls would be lost on conversion anyway)</li>
<li>Corrected the engine's offset error in the player's skillset which meant that serving a jail sentence did not affect all available skills, including that the intended and documented possible increase(s) to Sneak and Security would never appear (requires OBSE)</li>
<li>Fixed the pressure plates and stair switch activator in Vahtacen Lorsel (Mages Guild Vahtacen's Secret quest) not working if the player left the cell and it reset, which could break the questline (also fixed minor error of the pressure plates not animating when triggered)</li>
<li>The player will no longer be able to trigger the post-Main-Quest Akatosh statue from outside the Temple of the One (Imperial City) and so receive two blessings per day (also optimized the scripting on it)</li>
<li>Turned quest flag and/or enabled No Low-Level Processing flag for numerous NPCs who did not require them which will reduce the amount of AI processing that is required (if OBSE is present, a script will apply the Low-Level Processing changes to an existing save; otherwise it will take effect on a new game)</li>
<li>Optimized the scripting on the altars of the Nine Divines</li>
<li>Various powers, lesser powers and spells acquired from runestones have been made immune to silencing (the latter were made lesser powers to facilitate this)</li>
<li>Spells from shrines, wells, stones, etc., have all been set to a zero magicka cost to avoid spell failure</li>
<li>Removed an extra endif to correct the scripts DABoethiaCageOpenScript01, MG09Script, MG19ChestScript and RufioDie_Script</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>After the Unexpected Voyage, Graman gro-Marad will resume his normal schedule instead of remaining in the Bloated Float never eating or sleeping for the rest of the game</li>
<li>Prevented the Unfriendly Competition quest from starting if Agarmir is already dead, as otherwise it would continue normally until Thoronir's meeting with him, then be unfinishable</li>
<li>Also in Unfriendly Competition, picking up Agarmir's shovel before he is dead will no longer inexplicably stall the quest until it is dropped and picked up again after he is slain</li>
<li>In the quest A Brotherhood Betrayed, Carius Runellius will no longer get into a dialog loop requiring a reload if the player enters Olav's Tap and Tack wearing the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal</li>
<li>Also in A Brotherhood Betrayed, Olav will no longer give the player a second copy of his key if the player already pickpocketed it</li>
<li>The location of all usable fences, or the location of Amusei or Methredhel if the player is waiting for them, will now be shown when Independent Thievery quest is selected as the active quest.</li>
<li>In the quest May the Best Thief Win (Thieves Guild), if the player murders Rohssan and then steals her cutlass afterwards, it will no longer cause a quest update (even if the quest is over) and be stuck in inventory as a quest item (will fix existing saves)</li>
<li>After the Misdirection quest (Thieves Guild) is completed, activating the nightstand in the Archmage's Quarters in the IC Arcane University (ie if the player is the Archmage) will no longer remove the note from the Gray Fox from the player's inventory if it is present</li>
<li>In the Turning a Blind Eye quest (Thieves Guild) the player will no longer be able to steal Savilla's Stone without using sneak mode or other stealth tactics and remain undetected</li>
<li>In the Boots of Springheel Jak quest (Thieves Guild), corrected dialog conditions so Gemellus Axius will now indicate properly if Jakben, Earl of Imbel is not at home</li>
<li>In The Ultimate Heist quest (Thieves Guild) if the player is detected in the palace, the Palace Guards will no longer fight each other to the death (especially noticed if the player became invisible), the Palace Guards will no longer arrest the player as was intended (as this will allow the player to easily keep the Boots of Springheel Jak and somewhat ridiculously also have the stolen Elder Scroll returned to them on release!) and if this occurs after successfully stealing the Elder Scroll and the player escapes the palace they will no longer be stuck in perpetual combat mode unable to sleep, wait or fast travel, even after paying off their bounty</li>
<li>Also in The Ultimate Heist, Anvil residents will no longer say that Count Umbranox has returned before he actually has</li>
<li>The front door's scripting in Summitmist Manor during the Whodunit? quest (Dark Brotherhood) will no longer trap followers and other NPC's that may happen to enter inside, and the player will no longer be able to leave before all the guests are dead due to an incorrect check.</li>
<li>The player will no longer be able to attack the guests in the Whodunit? quest outright without being detected, due to the scripting checking an invalid event code</li>
<li>In Whodunit? Matilde Petit will now properly accompany Neville and Dovesi Dran will accompany Primo Antonius around Summitmist Manor (couldn't as AI was not set up properly)</li>
<li>Fixed (severe) exploit in the quest Honor Thy Mother (Dark Brotherhood) where the player could repeatedly talk to the Night Mother at the questline's finale and receive the Blade Of Woe reward each time</li>
<li>The player will no longer be able to keep the Staff of the Everscamp in the Whom Gods Annoy quest by placing it into a corpse rather than dropping it</li>
<li>In the Two Sides of the Coin quest, Tyrellius Logellus will no longer appear outside Bruma and confront the player at the quest's conclusion if he's already dead</li>
<li>Similarly if the player escapes the jail without waiting or sleeping, a duplicate of Tyrellius will not remain in the dungeon</li>
<li>Fixed the player being easily able to permanently prevent the conversation in Two Sides of the Coin between Tyrellius Logellus and Jorundr in Bruma castle jail just by standing between them or walking into Jorundr</li>
<li>Ulrich Leland will no longer go to Bruma to sleep after the Great Gate quest is complete, which could interrupt Corruption and Conscience</li>
<li>Closed two more possible unlimited-gold exploits in the Corruption and Conscience quest's reward</li>
<li>Corrected the name of Arnora Auria's corpse in the Two Sides of the Coin quest from just "Arnora" to "Arnora Auria"</li>
<li>In the Sheogorath shrine quest, if the player pickpockets the rat poison from Ri'Bassa, they will no longer be able to activate the trough with it out of order, as this would cause part of the quest and the K'Sharra prophecy to be skipped</li>
<li>In the Boethia shrine quest's Tournament of Ten Bloods, the opponents will no longer yield to the player (reverting to normal NPC's with rumor dialog; the Khajiit was a highwayman who would rob the player if spoken to)</li>
<li>In Block Training, when master trainer Andragil performs the sparring test with the player, she will now properly recognize if the player unequips their shield, unsheathes a weapon or hits her and terminate the test</li>
<li>Starting the Molag Bal shrine quest will no longer block Olyn Seran from talking about Conjuration Training (would occur even if the player couldn't proceed with Molag Bal due to being too low-level)</li>
<li>After the quest Information At A Price (Mages Guild) is completed, the vampire hunters will leave Skingrad as they and the quest journal indicate (should they survive, they'll hunt vampires in three non-quest locations, but in reality they'll probably die in the wilderness before they reach even one of them)</li>
<li>In the Confront the King quest (Mages Guild) if Mannimarco misses the player when casting his paralysis spell, he will no longer then stand around waiting for the player to talk to or attack him</li>
<li>Also in Confront the King, if the players kills Bolor Savel before he talks to the player/attacks, this will no longer be counted as a murder</li>
<li>After the Nothing You Can Possess quest, S'razirr will now have the missing dialog option to pay him his share of the reward if the player returned the Ayleid carving to Claude Maric</li>
<li>In the Secrets of the Ayleids quest, the Ayleid Crown of Nenalata and Staff of Nenalata will no longer be unquippable and/or quest items when retrieved from the King of Nenalata's corpse</li>
<li>Also in the Secrets of the Ayleids quest, the King of Nenalata will no longer speak his last line if he's already dead</li>
<li>After the quest The Renegade Shadowscale (Dark Brotherhood) is completed, Scar-Tail's death will no longer cause a quest update to take his heart to Teinaava</li>
<li>After the quest Permanent Retirement (Dark Brotherhood) is completed, removing Adamus Phillida's severed finger from his desk and then replacing it will no longer cause a quest update</li>
<li>After the Mystery at Harlun's Watch quest (Fighters Guild) is completed, Harlun's Watch residents will no longer say that they need help</li>
<li>During the Infiltration quest (Fighters Guild) Ja'Fazir will no longer yield to the player, who would then be required to murder or pickpocket him to continue</li>
<li>Also during the Infiltration quest, if the player attacks and knocks out the three (essential) Blackwood Company Guards before drinking the Hist Sap, this will no longer cause them to disappear completely when the player goes to Water's Edge and stall the quest</li>
<li>Also during the Infiltration quest, the player will no longer be transported from Water's Edge if they are riding a horse, which would leave it stuck inside Modryn Oreyn's house</li>
<li>The Water's Edge residents Marie Alouette, Eduard Retien and Jolie Retiene will be essential until the Infiltration quest, as otherwise they could be long-dead and yet their corpses would reappear and the quest would still proceed as though the player along with the Blackwood Company slaughtered them</li>
<li>In the Go Fish quest, asking Aerin Merowald multiple times about his savings will no longer add multiple copies of his key to his inventory (he will only talk about it once)</li>
<li>Aerin Merowald's savings chest will now contain the proper amount of gold (minimum 500); was not appearing due to an engine bug with leveled lists</li>
<li>In the Order of the Virtuous Blood quest, if the player initially sides with Roland but then murders him, changes to Seridur will be properly undone (such as not wearing armor for the remainder of the game)</li>
<li>Also in Order of the Virtuous Blood, if the player sides with Seridur, he will be made non-essential after the quest, as he is involved in no other quests</li>
<li>While Seridur is in Memorial Cave in Order of the Virtuous Blood, he will no longer be attacked by creatures there due to missing faction membership, and he will no longer prematurely greet the player.</li>
<li>If Mazoga the Orc dies before the completion of the Knights of the White Stallion quest, her corpse will no longer gain a Leyawiin shield and White Stallion Lodge key when the player does</li>
<li>Fixed several errors with Black Brugo's AI in the Knights of the White Stallion quest: He will now be able to reliably retrieve the gold in Telepe (the coffer was placed too high for him to reach it easily), he will rejoin the rest of the bandits after retrieving the gold rather than randomly wandering, and he won't follow Alonzo if Alonzo is dead.</li>
<li>In the Paranoia quest, fixed Glarthir's AI so that after meeting with the player behind the chapel and going home, he doesn't then go right back to the chapel again; this allowed the quest to be completed in a single four-hour in-game timeframe</li>
<li>If the Paranoia quest has terminated prematurely, Glarthir will no longer continue to wait for the player behind the Skingrad chapel as if it was still running</li>
<li>Dion will only confront the Paranoia quest in Skingrad regarding involvment with Glarthir has been corrected so that he will only confront the player if Glarthir has approached the player first</li>
<li>A missing line of dialog from Glarthir in the Paranoia quest about Davide Surilie will now be heard</li>
<li>In the quest Through A Nightmare, Darkly, if the player equips and then unequips the Dreamworld Amulet they will no longer enter the Dreamworld on next rest (it must be equipped, as the quest indicates)</li>
<li>Post-quest rumors regarding the Knights of the White Stallion will now appear for Leyawiin residents; did not before due to incorrect conditions</li>
<li>Added an alternate journal entry to The Forlorn Watchman to replace one that indicated that the player had read the Emma May's log even if they didn't</li>
<li>Maraska will no longer remain essential if the player completes the Clavicus Vile shrine quest by refusing to give up Umbra (not involved in future quests and if the player did give up Umbra, was being made non-essential)</li>
<li>If any of the three Fighters Guild members the player assists in the Fighters Guild quest The Desolate Mine die after successful quest completion, this will no longer result in rumors that the quest was failed</li>
<li>Mythic Dawn sleeper agents throughout Cyrodiil will no longer give themselves away by casting their bound armor/weapon spell before the Dagon Shrine quest has completed</li>
<li>Cingor will now be removed from the Fighters Guild after the Dagon Shrine quest, rather than the Mythic Dawn, and will also have the Mythic Dawn bound armor spell he was missing.</li>
<li>Picking up the Mysterium Xarxes (required) in the Lake Arrius Caverns during the Dagon Shrine quest will no longer be theft that increases the player's Items Stolen count.</li>
<li>If the player leaves the chapel in the Breaking the Siege of Kvatch quest before Tierra has finished speaking with Savilian Matius, this should no longer cause her to not escort the civilians to the encampment</li>
<li>After the player clears the first phase and enters the chapel in the Breaking the Siege of Kvatch quest, Merandil will no longer repeatedly leave and re-enter the chapel (if he is still alive) due to an AI loop</li>
<li>Two lines of dialog for Jesan Rilian in the Breaking the Siege of Kvatch quest will now appear; did not before due to incorrect conditions</li>
<li>Menien Goneld (Kvatch Oblivion plane) will be disabled at the end of the Breaking the Siege of Kvatch quest due to (extremely rare) occurrences of him reappearing in Tamriel for no apparent reason</li>
<li>Missing dialog and its Ormellius Goldwine topic will now appear in the Breaking the Siege of Kvatch quest</li>
<li>Kirsten (Bleaker's Way) will now return to the Goodwill Inn and offer services if the Mephala shrine quest is failed</li>
<li>Fixed Rythe Lythandas so that he can't be attacked in a Brush with Death while making the exit portal, as otherwise (such as if a Painted Troll hit him) the player would be left stuck in the Painted World with the quest broken</li>
<li>Karinnarre (Novaroma, Bruma) will no longer erroneously turn into a merchant and offer services for the brief time during The Defense of Bruma quest that it takes Martin to walk from the chapel to the battlefield</li>
<li>After the Main Quest has been completed for a sufficient amount of time, NPCs will no longer discuss events in other parts of Tamriel as if the Oblivion Crisis was still underway, and Imperial Legionnaires will no longer talk about the death of the Emperor as though it is news.</li>
<li>Martin and Jauffre's horses will no longer hang around the Talos Plaza entrance after the Main Quest has been completed for the rest of the game.</li>
<li>At the conclusion of the Lifting the Vale quest, the player will no longer be able to talk to Akavari Commander Mishaxhi before he disappears, as the thousand-year-old ghost would reply in a normal Imperial voice discussing current events</li>
<li>A long greeting from Caminalda (Brina Cross Inn) in the Mages Guild Anvil Recommendation quest if she is spoken to before renting a room will now appear; would not before due to incorrect conditions</li>
<li>A piece of Maelona's (Anvil) dialog at the beginning of the Siren's Deception quest if the player heard about the Sirens before talking to her will now appear; would not before as it was unlinked</li>
<li>Amusei will no longer use his imprisoned greetings for the Thieves Guild Atonement quest before he's actually imprisoned</li>
<li>Amusei will now visit the guildhall for the intended two days a week at the end of the Thieves Guild questline</li>
<li>Velwyn Benirus will now use the correct greeting on first meeting the player in the quest Where Spirits Have Lease depending on whether the player had heard of him from townspeople</li>

<li>If the player opts to pay a highwayman when robbed, gold will now properly be removed from the player</li>
<li>Removed unnecessary permanent Essential status from Skingrad's West Weald innkeeper Erina Jeranus; she is involved in no quests and an AI reference indicates this was (yet another) leftover from the removed Imperial Express/Courier quest</li>
<li>A much longer alternate goodbye dialog from Emperor Uriel Septim that was not set up properly will now appear</li>
<li>Fights should no longer break out in Olav's Tap and Tack (Bruma) due to several NPCs who frequent there missing faction memberships causing their eating to be counted as theft</li>
<li>Some Imperial Legion Foresters will no longer be missing their cuirasses</li>
<li>Split 51 NPC scheduled visit packages that cross midnight for specific days of the week or month due to an engine bug that causes them to duplicate the before and after midnight portion on the previous and next days</li>
<li>Orok gro-Ghoth's (Chorrol), Delmar's (IC Arcane University) and Uurwen's (Cheydinhal Mages Guild) unique greetings on first meeting the player will now be used; couldn't play due to incorrect conditions</li>

<li>Didier Aumilie (Anvil) and Istrius Brolus (Bruma) will no longer use a goodbye that was missing its audio and lip movement (had never been recorded for Breton males; was actually a leftover from early development when there were Arenas in all towns; this was actually fixed long ago but not documented in the UOP changelog)</li>

<li>Amusei will no longer walk to the IC Waterfront to sleep unnecessarily before the Thieves Guild questline has begun</li>
<li>Augusta Calidia (IC Talos Plaza District) will now sleep in her private bed at the Tiber Septim; time was conflicting her her AI to read</li>
<li>Neville (Skingrad, Summitmist Manor) will no longer sleep almost constantly due to his sleep AI lacking a start time</li>

<li>Ida Vlinorman will no longer interrupt her visit to Chorrol to wander back to the Imperial City Arena to gamble and then return (yet another leftover of early development when there was an Arena in Chorrol)</li>
<li>Eilonwy and Orintur (Cheydinhal) will now sleep in their own house (Willow Bank) rather than the Mages Guild, as otherwise their own house was completely unused and the Mages Guild was two beds short (they also started in Willow Bank yet then immediately left and never returned, and share a sleep package no one else has, so it appears this was an oversight)</li>
<li>Fixed Urjabhi and Collatinus Vedius (IC Talos Plaza district) never sleeping as there were no beds where their AI packages were indicating</li>
<li>Fixed Bejeen (Leyawiin, Weebam-Na's house) never sleeping due to impossible AI conditions and Maknok gro-Coblug (Cheydinhal Riverview) never sleeping as his AI was out of order</li>
<li>S'Thasa (Border Watch Inn) will no longer wander near the barrels trying to get to one of the beds in a locked room as she was never assigned her bedroll</li>

<li>Anguilon (Anvil) will no longer stand in place during his visit to Anvil's pond due to his AI having a zero radius</li>
<li>Shagol gro-Bumph (Aleswell) should no longer rake his fence</li>
<li>Reman Broder (Skingrad vineyards) should put his hoe away when he's done working, rather than eating while still holding it</li>

<li>Two Mages Guild rumors about Falcar (Cheydinhal) will now appear there, and no longer be used by Mages Guild members in Skingrad</li>
<li>Some Cheydinhal NPC non-quest rumor dialog should no longer appear in other towns</li>
<li>A missing topic/line of dialog from Borba gra-Uzgash (Borba's Goods and Stores, Cheydinhal) will now appear regarding daedric shrines if the player read Martin's copy of The Refugees (it was neglected to make a script for the book)</li>
<li>Hlidara Mothril will now be able to follow Countess Alessia Caro into the Mahei house (Leyawiin) which she couldn't due to missing faction membership</li>
<li>Countess Alessia Caro will now use the proper chair when she eats dinner in Leyawiin castle (outside of the Sanguine shrine quest)</li>
<li>Shum gro-Yarug will now attend to Count Janus Hassildor in Skingrad Castle's Lord's Manor in the evenings (couldn't as his AI was not set up properly)</li>
<li>The daedra Kathutet, Ranyu, Orthe, and Amkaos, the Dremora Scouts and the Dremora Sigil Keeper in the Breaking the Siege of Kvatch quest, and the Dremora Kynval in the temple attack in Light the Dragonfires will now properly drop daedra hearts upon death</li>
<li>The vampiric Afflicted Brethren in Gutted Mine will no longer carry their vampire dust in inventory (where it can be pickpocketed) and two of them will no longer be missing their innate spell</li>
<li>The Water's Edge residents Marie Alouette, Biene Amelion, Eduard Retien and Jolie Retiene will no longer stay in their houses constantly due to their outdoor AI being the wrong type</li>
<li>Rena Bruiant and Varanus Donton will now attend daily worship regardless of the state of the Canvas the Castle quest (they are not involved in it)</li>
<li>Numerous Bravil NPC's using any of 8 chapel altar packages will now activate the correct altars, including Hans Black-Nail who, while activating the altar of Arkay, won't receive the blessing from the Tiber Septim altar across the chapel.</li>
</ul>

<b>Creature Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The lich Erandur-Vangaril will now have proper health (15x the player's level, as is standard for all liches, instead of merely 15 which made for an anticlimactic battle)</li>
<li>Added missing undead faction membership to Gable the Traitor (wraith in the Emma May) as he was likely to be attacked by his allies</li>
<li>NPCs and the player will now properly head-track Clannfears and Daedroths instead of looking upwards where their head would be if they were standing completely upright (especially noticed with corpses)</li>
<li>Ghosts and wraiths will now be immune to paralysis as they should have been (they were not given a falling-down animation so couldn't be hit when paralyzed as only their ectoplasm "corpse" had collision)</li>
<li>Ghosts' ranged frost damage spell is now immune to silence as all other ghost spells are</li>
<li>Ancient Ghosts' on-touch frost damage spells will no longer be both ranged and on-touch at the same time</li>
<li>Mudcrabs will now have the death sounds that they should have had</li>
<li>Bay, Paint and White horses will no longer return to their original location to wander instead of wandering "in place" due to incorrect AI</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The player will no longer be able to give away the receipts for all player home upgrade furniture, paintings, etc. immediately after buying them; the receipts would disappear from the merchant's inventory so couldn't be bought again, and the upgrade(s) would never be installed (would also happen if the player immediately dropped them, although the upgrades would appear if they were picked up again and kept)</li>
<li>Cyrodiilic Brandy will now use the unique mesh ( Meshes\Clutter\BrandyBottle.NIF ) that was designed for it and never used probably due to an oversight, rather than appearing as a generic potion (see below in Meshes); also changed its icon to a wine bottle's to reflect the change as this is the closest match to its shape</li>
<li>Dropped unlit torches will no longer acquire a flame that casts no light on cell reload (such as by fast-traveling away and back)</li>
<li>Merchants will now sell Steel Battleaxes properly and Iron Warhammers will be sold at level 1 (Leveled list had Steel War Axes duplicated and Iron Warhammers incorrectly starting at level 11)</li>
<li>Broadhead Gauntlets, Gauntlets of Lockbreaking (Mithril), Huntsman Gauntlets, Gauntlets of Passing (Elven), Clear Sight Gauntlets and Magnifying Gauntlets (Glass) will now be carried by NPCs; were omitted from leveled lists and there were no others with equivalent effects present</li>
<li>Smuggler's Boots (Mithril), Boots of the Forest Stalker (Elven) and Boots of Soft Walking (Glass) will now be carried by NPCs; were omitted from leveled lists and there were no others with equivalent effects present</li>
<li>The Vvardenfell Trader's Cuirass (Mithril), Cuirass of the Farlands Trader (Elven) and Blower's Cuirass (Glass) will now be carried by NPCs; were omitted from leveled lists and there were no others with equivalent effects present</li>
<li>Elven shields and Orcish shields have been changed places in the leveled lists; light Elven were erroneously in the Heavy lists and heavy Orcish were in the Light lists</li>
<li>The (Dwarven) Arrow of Savage Frost and Arrow of Silence will have the correct (Dwarven) in-game model and icon, not those of iron arrows.</li>
<li>The Cursed Mace (from the Molag Bal shrine quest), and the daedric arrows Arrow of the Inferno, Arrow of Winter, Arrow of Storms, and Magebane Arrow will now ignore normal weapon resistance as all other daedric weapons do.</li>
<li>Added six types of War Axes with Soul Trap effects that were missing from leveled lists so that NPCs will now carry them</li>
<li>Corrected the Armor Rating value for all fur shields being only one-third what it should have been (2.00 rather than 6.00; for all other armors the shield's AR is 1.2x the value for the cuirass.) Affected shields are: Eagle Feather Shield, Fur Shield (normal and Arena varieties), Mudcrab Shield, Salamander Scale Shield and Tiger Fang Shield</li>
<li>Corrected the damage for the Rusty Iron Dagger found in the tutorial dungeon from 5 (which is the damage of a proper Iron Dagger) to 3 (which matches all other Rusty Iron Daggers), its health from 60 to 35 and value from 5 to 2 (which also matches all other Rusty Iron Daggers)</li>
<li>Corrected the damage for the Rusty Iron Bow from 8 to 6, its health from 90 to 56 and its value from 10 to 3 which brings it in line with all other rusty weapons; the proper Iron Bow has a damage of 8, and other rusty weapons' health is half that and value one third that of the proper (this item is only found in the tutorial dungeon)</li>
<li>Corrected the damage for the Rusty Iron War Axe from 5 to 6 which brings it in line with all other rusty weapons</li>
<li>Corrected the damage for the Arrow of Discord from 9 to 4 which applies the -5 penalty all other area-effect arrows have</li>
<li>Corrected the weights of normal and enchanted silver claymores from 38 to 32, bringing them in line with other silver weapons in relation to other weapons (Silver Claymore, Claymore of Curses, Claymore of Depletion and Claymore of Dispel)</li>
<li>Corrected the weights of normal and enchanted steel battle axes from 35 to 34, bringing them in line with other steel weapons in relation to other weapons (Steel Battle Axe, Battle Axe of Burning, Battle Axe of Diminishing, Battle Axe of Jolts, Battle Axe of Numbing and Battle Axe of Seduction)</li>
<li>Corrected the weight of the Fine Steel Dagger from 3.5 to 3.6. bringing it in line with other fine steel weapons </li>
<li>Corrected the weight of dwarven arrows from 0.15 to 0.1 (which matches all all other arrows including enchanted dwarven)</li>
<li>Corrected the value of enchanted silver longswords from 80 to 125 as they weren't even worth as much as an unenchanted one, unlike all other weapons (Longsword of Depletion, Longsword of Dispel, Longsword of Frost {Martin's}, Longsword of Jinxing and Longsword of Sapping)</li>
<li>Corrected the speed of the Akaviri Warblade from 0.9 to 1 which matches all other Akaviri weapons</li>
<li>Corrected the health of the enchanted iron Daggers of Embers, Frost, Pacification, Sparks and Weariness from 360 to 70</li>
<li>Fixed the following orcish armor using the chainmail mesh and/or icon on female players: Swamp Boots, Peak Climber's Boots, Storm Stomper Boots, Battlehunter Gauntlets, Warmaster Gauntlets, Gauntlets of Brutality, Savage Gauntlets, Snowblind Gauntlets, Gauntlets of Survival, Greaves of the Warmonger, Fire Ritual Greaves, Greaves of the Unstoppable, Magekiller Greaves, Battlehunter Helmet, Shaman Helmet, Darksplitter Helmet and Helmet of the Drowned (were actually fixed long ago but not documented in the UOP changelog)</li>
<li>The unique Gauntlets of Gluttony will no longer look like iron gauntlets in inventory and when dropped, though they are orcish when worn (internal name indicates this as well)</li>
<li>The Mountaineer's Shield will no longer inexplicably also take up the tail slot in addition to the shield slot</li>
<li>Fixed Tutorial dungeon Rough Leather Greaves (name was already corrected from Leather Greaves to match the rest of the set) using the male mesh when worn by female players</li>
<li>As was done already with other similar items (such as the Ring of Wortcraft) fixed the Fortify Alchemy enchantment of the Ring of Wizardry, Base Ring of Alchemy, Ring of Alchemy and Grand Ring of Alchemy so that their Fortify Alchemy effect works (NOTE: exit out of menu mode after wearing them in order for them to take effect; the Fortify Alchemy effect on the character sheet will show twice for each item and its value will be twice the true value, but this is the only way to get it to work properly)</li>
<li>Corrected the magnitude of the Fortify Health enchantment of the Base Ring of Health, Cuirass of the Bear and Ironheart Cuirass from 15 to 10</li>
<li>Corrected the reversed enchantment magnitudes of the Ring of Firewalking and Grand Ring of Firewalking (was actually fixed long ago but not documented in the UOP changelog)</li>
<li>Corrected the reversed enchantment magnitudes of the Staff of Sundering and Greater Staff of Sundering</li>
</ul>

<b>Texture Fixes</b>

<li>NPCs should no longer fall through the Talos Bridge (from the Imperial City to Weye)</li>
<li>The boss-level chest in Lost Black Rock Chasm will now contain the proper amount of gold (minimum 1,766); was not appearing due to an engine bug with leveled lists</li>
<li>The player will no longer be able to walk over the hole behind Arvena Thelas' house in Anvil (would float over it)</li>
<li>Replaced the six individual steel arrows on the floor in Honditar's house (Chorrol) with a quiver of six arrows; when the player picked the individual arrows up due to an inventory stacking bug with stolen items they could be duplicated indefinitely just by selecting them.</li>
<li>Replaced the altar in Cadlew Chapel with a static one; the altar is covered with severed arms and the blessing couldn't hit the player, but the message would still appear that the player was blessed, and then further blessings from normal altars wouldn't work for a day</li>
<li>The chest in the tutorial dungeon containing the rusty iron armor will no longer be missing the gauntlets, and the skeleton with the rough leather gear will no longer be missing the helmet and gloves (the missing items have the tutorial script attached, but were not used anywhere in it, so they do appear to be oversights that they were missing)</li>

<li>Corrected the ownership of the beds in Uuras the Shepherd's and Tamika's houses (Skingrad), Shelley's bed in the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn basement, Corrick Northwode's bed in Harm's Folly, and S'Thasa's bedroll in the Border Watch Inn so that the player can't sleep in them (the latter was actually fixed long ago but not documented in the UOP changelog)</li>

<li>Created completely missing audio for a line of dialog of M'aiq the Liar</li>

<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for an instance where Modryn Oreyn refers to the Blackwood Company as the "Blackheart Company"</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle on a line of dialog from Athrelor (Kvatch) indicating that he's "open for business" whereas there's no other hint he was ever intended to offer merchant or other services</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for three lines of Imperial and Breton IC rumor dialog that confused Irene Metrick with Ida Vlinorman (another for Redguards couldn't be fixed satisfactorily so will just not be heard)</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for a Skingrad rumor about Agnete the Pickled for female Argonians and Khajiit that was slightly off from the subtitle (the male one matched).</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for Corrick Northwode in the Revenge Served Cold quest saying that Exhausted Mine is southeast of Harm's Folly (it's southwest)</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for Mercator Hosidus in the Mages Guild Ulterior Motives quest saying that the meeting place is north of Cursed Mine (it's south)</li>

<li>Fixed outtake line of elven female Thieves Guild rumor in Leyawiin regarding Adharji's Heirloom if the player triggered the Blood Price</li>
<li>Fixed an outtake line of male Imperial Mages Guild Arcane University conversation regarding a breakthrough</li>
<li>Corrected audio on a Nord male line of dialog on joining the Fighters Guild that was different from all others and incorrect (didn't match its subtitle either)</li>
<li>Corrected audio on a Nord male line of dialog referring the player to an incorrect NPC to start the Forlorn Watchman quest that was different from all others (also didn't match its subtitle either)</li>
<li>Replaced a line of dialog for Tolger (Temple of the Ancestor Moth; also a Nord male) in the Thieves Guild Turning a Blind Eye quest as it was being read in a completely different voice</li>
<li>Corrected audio files for boar footsteps as they were duplicated (two footfalls playing per step taken)</li>

<li>Corrected the falloff for dog and wolf yelps so that they can be heard in the distance properly</li>
<li>Corrected the music in the upstairs of Nerastarel's (abandoned, haunted) house in Skingrad to dungeon type, which matches the ground floor</li>
</ul>

<b>Text Fixes</b>
<ul>

<li>Corrected subtitle in Seed-Neeus gretting MS45_GREETING_000280C5_1: "I'm don't" -> "I don't"</li>
<li>Corrected journal text in Paranoia (MS48 stages, 51, 52, 53) : removed ", as Glarthir requested" as the player can murder the three targets before Glarthir requests it, receive these stages and complete the quest</li>
<li>Corrected journal text in The Wayward Knight (MS13 stage 115) : "with 200 gold" -> "in gold." (the gold reward is levelled and never exactly 200; "in gold" matches an equivalent stage of the same quest)</li>
<li>Corrected the title of the note placed in the Thieves Guild Misdirection quest: "Note from Gray Fox" -> "Note from The Gray Fox"</li>
<li>Corrected subtitle in Heinrich Oaken-Hull's greeting NQDAnvil_GREETING_0003E09B_1 : removed ", the Serpent's Wake," to match the audio (the Serpent's Wake is not his ship as the captain is dead so it appears that the audio was corrected but the subtitle neglected).</li>
<li>Corrected subtitle in Dervera Romalen's Cheydinhal topic dialog NQDCheydinhal_CheydinhalTopic_0004E88B_1 : "shall the twain" -> "the twain shall" to match the audio.</li>
<li>Corrected subtitle in Skingrad Jailor dialog TG06Atonement_TG06OpenDoor_0000C20A_1: "have to" -> "gotta" to match the audio</li>
<li>Corrected subtitle in Skingrad beggar Foul Fagus dialog TG06Atonement_TG06GetIntoDungeons_0003D803_1: "dungeons" -> "dungeon" to match the audio</li>

<li>Corrected subtitle in Elisa Pierrane dialog ArenaDialogue_GREETING_000C456C_1: "Roderick" -> "Roderic"</li>
<li>Corrected subtitle in Skingrad rumor dialog NQDSkingrad_INFOGENERAL_0003C248_1 and NQDSkingrad_SkingradNQDResponses_0003C1F5_1: "Ambrose" -> "Ambroise"</li>

</ul>

<p class="h">v3.3.7 - Hotfix (2011-07-17)</p>

<li>Grounded a floating sack and a floating barrel in the Market District Warehouse basement cell.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.3.6 (2011-07-08)</p>
<b>Mesh Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Added missing Havok collision on the Chorrol house for sale sign CitySignsChorrol.NIF</li>
<li>Optimized oversized Havok collision on statues GarridanFrozen.NIF, ICDragonStatue01.NIF, StatueGodAkatosh01.NIF, StatueGodArkay01.NIF, StatueGodDibella01.NIF, StatueGodJulianos01.NIF, StatueGodKynareth01.NIF, StatueGodMara01.NIF, StatueGodSeptim01.NIF, StatueGodStendarr01.NIF, StatueImperial02-5.NIFsStatueLeyawiin01.NIF, StatueTownBruma01.NIF and StatueTownCheydinhal01.NIF reducing in size from 6.35MB to 4.87MB in total</li>
<li>Corrected misaligned Havok collision at the top of BravilCastleTower01.NIF (normally inacessible) and optimized from 155KB to 134KB</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>If the Paranoia quest (MS38) terminates with Glarthir's death, Skingrad residents will no longer talk about him as though he were alive.</li>
<li>Fame rewards for Blood of the Daedra, Blood of the Divines, Paradise, and Origin of the Gray Prince are never applied.</li>
<li>Fame reward for Imperial Corruption is never applied, however the fix cannot be reliably used for a save in which the quest is already done since Audens could be killed by someone other than the player. There is no way to detect who killed an NPC after the fact.</li>
<li>The infamy award for Affairs of a Wizard is never properly applied.</li>
<li>In Ahdarji's Heirloom, Amusei is removed from the Leyawiin faction twice, and added to the Skingrad faction twice. This results in a bug in which he ends up in the wrong city factions at the end of the quest.</li>
<li>If the initial Thieves Guild quest is completed by stealing Rohssan's sword, the journal entries where Armand gives you the guild rules are never called because they don't exist for that quest stage.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where if the player unlocks Amusei's jail cell in Leyawiin before offering him a lockpick the quest will not proceed until the offer is made.</li>
<li>Garrus Darelliun will be marked essential until Corruption and Conscience begins, as was done with the other involved NPCs already.</li>
<li>The last stage of Information at a Price will no longer try to restart the Vampire Cure quest for no apparent reason (it already starts on a new game anyway)</li>
<li>During "Spies" Jeral's body is not always unmarked as a quest object and the corpse will therefore never be cleaned out of the game.</li>
<li>Cheydinhal's non-quest dialogue conditions were not properly restricting their use to the city's faction members.</li>
<li>Volanaro (Bruma Mages Guild) will no longer lose his essential status at the end of the Bruma Recommendation quest, as otherwise if he died long enough before the A Plot Revealed quest that his corpse disappeared, it would still reappear during A Plot Revealed</li>
<li>During the DB Purification quest, Telaendril's body was not clearing it's quest item flag and therefore the corpse would never be cleaned out of the game.</li>
<li>The Chorrol castle key will no longer remain a quest item after the Canvas the Castle quest is completeted.</li>
<li>In Ultimate Heist, if the player attacks the Blind Monks in the Imperial Palace, this will now expel the player from the Thieves Guild and end the quest as it was supposed to.</li>
<li>During Ultimate Heist, even if the player was not sneaking, it was possible to steal Savila's Stone without being detected.</li>
<li>Prevented the Unexpected Voyage quest from starting if either Ormil or Graman gro-Marad are dead, which would leave it unfinishable with the player stuck at sea.</li>
<li>The Sanguine shrine quest will now stop properly once it has been completed.</li>
<li>In the Permanent Retirement quest (Dark Brotherhood), if Adamus Phillida is attacked without using the Rose of Sithis while swimming, he will put his armor back on.</li>
<li>The reward chests for both the Two Sides of the Coin and The Forlorn Watchman will now be populated with items leveled for when the player actually completes the quests, rather than for when they were started or level 1.</li>
<li>In the Information Gathering quest (Fighters Guild) if the player accidentally kills Ajum-Kajin during the interrogation, this will now advance the quest as intended.</li>
<li>Numerous dialogue conditions have been fixed, and several missing dialogue entries were added which already had recorded voice files.</li>
</ul>

Note: Fame and infamy fixes will be auto-corrected. Users of mods like Oblivion XP may find themselves suddenly gaining several experience point bumps. This is expected, as they are points you should have received but didn't due to the buggy way the game was trying to modify them.

<br><br><b>NPC, Creature & AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>After Through A Nightmare, Darkly, Henantier never loses his quest object flag so if he's killed afterward, his body will never clear out.</li>

<li>The YvaraChannitteDailyAudience AI pack will only trigger when the countess is actually present in the Bruma castle so Yvara won't follow her off to the chapel during the MQ.</li>
<li>Burz gro-Khash's afternoon sparring session at the Cheydinhal Fighters Guild will now work properly (AI had been set to the wrong type)</li>
<li>Bravil residents Brokil gro-Shatur, Olava the Fair, Dro'Nahrahe and Fathis Aren will now visit the Lucky Old Lady statue daily as was intended (except when the Dark Brotherhood quests Following A Lead or Honor Thy Mother are active)</li>
<li>Jean-Pierre Lemonds (Bravil) will now have a bow (his class is Sharpshooter, he had arrows already, and he would go hunting with no weapon).</li>
<li>In the Mages Guild quest Ulterior Motives, Mercator Hosidus will now consistently be wearing his necromancer robe when he confronts the player, and his class has been corrected to Necromancer so he will have access to the expected spells.</li>
<li>Gan Luseph and Tsavi both need chapel keys to access locked areas their routines send them to, but they never got those keys.</li>
<li>Improved the fix to the Guard class: restored the Marksman skill, and removed Athletics so that Light Armor skill can remain (note that the MMM check in the scripting will only take effect on a new game).</li>
<li>The LeyawiinGuardCountessAudience8x10 AI pack was set to the wrong type, and was also allowing thie affected NPC to follow the countess wherever she went.</li>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>EnchDwarvenWarhammerBurden, EnchDwarvenWaraxeDamLuck, EnchDwarvenMaceDamWillpower, CGClub, and EnchSteelMaceBurden should not be flagged to ignore weapon resistance.</li>

<li>The Poisoned Apple's script effect will be removed upon an NPC's death to prevent the effect sticking to NPCs that respawn (such as guards) as they would immediately die again repeatedly.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>An item duplication glitch has been fixed in a locked container inside Glarthir's house.</li>
<li>Anvil guard captain Langley and castle steward Dairihill's bed-sharing will now work properly (beds were all owned by the guard faction she was not a member of)</li>

</ul>

<b>Text Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected overlay text for the Skingrad town signs "SkinGrad" -> "Skingrad"</li>

<li>Corrected error in book "Guide to Chorrol" which stated: "Alessia Caro has been a good husband to Count Marius of Leyawiin" ("husband" -> "wife")</li>
<li>Corrected journal text in The Wayward Knight (MS13 stage 50) : "Breton" -> "Imperial" (referring to Bremman Senyan).</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.3.5 - Minor Update (2011-03-17)</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed StaffofDisintegrateWeaponLesser from LL1NPCStaff2Greater100.</li>
<li>Shortsword of Paralysis had an incorrect enchantment value of 800 that should have been 1600.</li>
<li>Staff of Calm had an enchantment value of 1600 when it should have been 1200.</li>
<li>Staff of Sundering and Greater Staff of Sundering had their enchantment values reversed.</li>
<li>Fixed crash to desktop that could occur after renting a room at several inns (one of which is Jerall View in Bruma) which also will resolve room rent never resetting so the bed remained usable for the rest of the game.</li>
<li>Several inns had no trigger object to reset rent variables and thus the player could rent the rooms indefinitely.</li>
<li>Improved the fix for the door to the Old Way in the Ultimate Heist by restoring the original door and locking it until required.</li>
<li>Fixed a few more inconsistent weapon names.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.3.4 - Minor Update (2011-02-03)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several errors with Deetsan's (Cheydinhal Mages Guild) AI schedule so that she can sleep and read at the right times (AI was out of order and one package didn't terminate properly).</li>
<li>The player will no longer be able to interrupt Rythe and Tivela before they complete their conversation the conclusion of A Brush With Death.</li>
<li>Fixed the fix for missing Havok collision on the bearskin rug ( BearSkinRug01.NIF ) so that it's in the right place in the file (had been in the UOP since almost the beginning but wasn't mentioned in the changelog).</li>
<li>Aryarie's two random wander AI packs also had a radius of zero, so she would simply stand in one place rather than moving about.</li>
<li>The script assigned to Aryarie was not generally able to pick a random percentage value for her AI schedule due to checking GameHour as though it were an integer value.</li>
<li>Steel battle axes are missing from VendorWeaponBlunt at level 3, steel warhammers are on the same list twice, and normal iron warhammers are incorrectly on this list at level 11.</li>
<li>EnchDwarvenBattleAxeDamEndurance is missing from LL0LootWeapon0Magic4Dwarven100.</li>
<li>EnchEbonyClaymoreTempest is missing from LL0LootWeapon0Magic7Ebony100.</li>
<li>EnchElvenDaggerDamIntelligence, EnchElvenBattleaxeDamEndurance, and EnchElvenClaymoreImmolator are missing from LL0LootWeapon0Magic5Elven100.</li>
<li>EnchSilverWaraxeDraMagicka is missing from LL0LootWeapon0Magic3Silver100.</li>
<li>EnchSteelBattleAxeDraEndurance and EnchSteelDaggerDraIntelligence are missing from LL0LootWeapon0Magic2Steel100.</li>
<li>EnchElvenClaymoreImmolator and EnchEbonyClaymoreTempest are missing from LL0NPCWeapon0MagicClaymore100 and LL0NPCWeapon0MagicClaymoreLvl100.</li>
<li>EnchSilverWaraxeDraMagicka is missing from LL0NPCWeapon0MagicWaraxe100 and LL0NPCWeapon0MagicWaraxeLvl100.</li>
<li>EnchSteelWarhammerBurden is missing from LL0NPCWeapon0MagicWarhammer100.</li>
<li>EnchSteelWarhammerBurden and EnchSilverWarhammerDraMagicka are missing from LL0NPCWeapon0MagicWarhammerLvl100.</li>
<li>EnchElvenClaymoreImmolator and EnchEbonyClaymoreTempest are missing from FGNPCWeapon0MagicClaymoreLvl100.</li>
<li>EnchElvenClaymoreImmolator and EnchEbonyClaymoreTempest are missing from SQ02LL0NPCWeapon0MagicClaymoreLvl100.</li>
<li>The wall behind Morvayn's Peacemakers in Anvil overlapped an adjacent segement, causing noticeable flickering.</li>
<li>Several weapon names have been updated for naming consistency with other UOP and USIP edits.</li>
<li>"Staff of the Pariah" had the wrong enchantment for it's quality level.</li>
<li>The interior door in the Faregyl Inn was out of alignment, leaving large gaps visible past it.</li>
<li>Several cells which have been known to exhibit missing landscape may now be resolved:
 <ul>
  <li>An hourglass was deleted in cell 20,-17 to prevent it from rolling down into cell 20,-18. This is on the road from Bravil to Leyawiin, under one of the bridges.</li>
  <li>A fort ruin chunk added to cell 16,13 to prevent beer bottles from rolling into cell 15,13 (Fort Magia).</li>
  <li>Rocks positioned in front of beer bottles in cell -34,12 (Infested Mine) to prevent them from rolling into cell -35,12.</li>
  <li>Several small stone bricks in Chorrol deleted to prevent them from being havok tossed over a cell border in -18,22 (ChorrolWorld).</li>
  <li>A pile of coins and a ring near Fort Farragut has been moved away from a ledge that could allow them to fall off and roll down the hill past the cell borders.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

Keep in mind that this may not solve the problem of disappearing landscape, but at least now the most likely cause has been identified.
In some cases you may need to find an isolated area and wait 4 days to get the cells to reset before the problem is fixed.

<p class="h">v3.3.3 - Minor Update (2010-10-31)</p>
<ul>
<li>Corruption and Conscience, that bastion of bugware that got called a quest, had yet another pair of holes that WERE NOT FIXED allowing for reward exploitation.
All dialogue branches in this quest have now been checked, and where necessary conditions placed to prevent post-completion exploits from being possible at all.
If the quest is still broken after this, another mod is causing the issue. Look to that mod's author to fix it in their mod.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.3.2 - Minor Update (2010-10-15)</p>
<ul>
<li>Arquen is supposed to lose her torch after the end of the DB quest, but due to a bad script command the item is never removed.</li>
<li>Collision corrected on ungrdtrapdoor.nif</li>
<li>Maro Rufus was wandering around bare chested after his AI packs were fixed.</li>
<li>The unique items weren't removed from M'raaj-Dar's chest in the Cheydinhal sanctuary.</li>
<li>Updated fixed Daedric arrow & quiver Meshes\Weapons\Daedric\Arrow.NIF as apparently the quiver could fall through the ground.</li>
<li>Created a normal map for fern fiddleheads ( BWFern05_n.dds ) as it was missing.</li>
<li>After the Arrow of Extrication quest, Glistel (Chorrol) will no longer remain for the rest of the game at the Oak & Crosier (and not offer training); she was only supposed to stay there while the player was meeting with the Gray Fox.</li>
<li>Corrected Havok collision type on Imperial City wanted poster WantedPoster02Static.NIF.</li>
<li>SignForSale01.NIF had the wrong havok material set.</li>
<li>Corrected incorrect Havok material type (stone rather than cloth) on TentRoof01.NIF and optimized from 40KB to 31KB.</li>
<li>SkingradCastleWall01.nif had the wrong havok material set.</li>
<li>Some floating chairs and beds intersecting walls in the Skingrad Fighters Guild were corrected.</li>
<li>The gate behind Aelwin Merowald's house in Weye was out of alignment with the stone wall.</li>
<li>Several clutter items in The Copius Coinpurse have been fixed.</li>
<li>Some of the Gray Fox wanted posters in the IC were not activateable due to being embedded too far into the walls.</li>
<li>AI pack CheydinhalWanderGardens12x5 has been given a radius of 512 so Shelly doesn't just stand in one spot when using it.</li>
<li>An unnecessary havok root added by the UOP was removed from Fallen Rock Cave.</li>
<li>Two static torch flames in the Sancre Tor Hub added by the UOP have been changed to injected IDs for better mod compatibility.</li>
<li>A useless light source added by the UOP in the Chorrol Chapel Hall has been removed. It was marked as disabled and would never be visible.</li>
<li>A useless flame added to the IC Arena by the UOP has been removed. It was marked as disabled and would never be visible.</li>
<li>A basement support added in the All Saints Inn Lodging area was accidentally placed where a vanilla object should have remained that did not need fixing.</li>
<li>Two light sources in Chorrol Castle Private Quarters added by the UOP were removed. They were marked as disabled and would never be visible.</li>
<li>An unnecessary piece added to the Imperial Palace Sewer by the UOP has been removed.</li>
<li>Four unnecessary light sources added by the UOP in the Chorrol Dungeon have been removed, and the two remaining which were disabled have been enabled to take their places.</li>
<li>Four unnecessary light sources added by the UOP in the Bruma Castle Lord's Manor have been removed. They were marked as disabled and would never be visible.</li>
<li>An AI pack added by the UOP for Kiara in Brina Cross Inn was not assigned. It has now been assigned to the intended NPC.</li>
<li>The UOP fix "quests" for Servatius Quintillus and the Renegade Shadowscale quest will now stop when they have made their changes.</li>
<li>The UOP fix "quest" for the quest item status of Llathasa's Bust was stopping another fix "quest" rather than itself; the incorrectly stopped quest has been assigned a new ID to be sure its functions are carried out.</li>
<li>UOPCarandialScript was not assigned to Carandial to make his horse return to the stable when he comes home from the ruins.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.3.1 - Minor Update (2010-09-19)</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrected Havok collision mesh on Leyawiin Fighters Guild dining hall piece LeyawiinFGInteriorDinning.NIF [sic] and optimized from 904KB to 840KB.</li>
<li>A hole in the floor of farmhouseinterior04.nif has been corrected.</li>
<li>Corrected the weight of one of the Metal Tankard clutter items (MiddleMetalTankard003) from zero to 0.5 to match the others.</li>
<li>The countereffects to the Absorb Magicka effect are now correctly Damage Magicka and Drain Magicka, rather than Damage Fatigue and Drain Fatigue.</li>
<li>Several portions of the Thieves Guild quest line could be triggered without the required amount of fenced stolen goods being sold.</li>
<li>Some conversation topics intended only for the player are also used by NPCs to greet each other.</li>
<li>The waterfront guards during the Misdirection quest will no longer ask each other if they have seen the Gray Fox, instead of just the residents.</li>
<li>Enilroth will no longer use his intimidated goodbye when talking to the player from the Dark Brotherhood quest Following a Lead after the quest is completed.</li>
<li>Gromm could be heard asking "Any idea what Gromm will do now that old Baenlin is dead?" which is obviously awkward.</li>
<li>Some previous fixes supplied for altar spells needed further fixing to correct them being made too easy to dispel.</li>
<li>The Vampire Cure quest's spell to remove the player's vampirism will no longer fail due to spell reflection/absorption or magicka resistance.</li>
<li>Silver BattleAxe" changed to "Silver Battle Axe" for consistency with other weapons of the type.</li>
<li>Reverted the fix to The Hist that was supposed to take Maglir out of the Fighters Guild to prevent expulsions. He was already out by that time and if setfactionrank -1 is used a second time on an NPC, they are actually added back in to the faction. In Maglir's case, this leads to a guaranteed expulsion. The original issue reported at the UESP site is wrong, and likely induced by either mods or someone having incorrectly used a console command.</li>
<li>The fix for Rythe Lythandas during A Brush With Death was insufficient to guard against stage 40 failing to trigger. A new trigger zone object replaces the GameMode script elements that were not reliable.</li>
<li>Two of the (mercenary) guards in Bleak Mine will no longer be guarding in their underwear due to missing pants/greaves.</li>
<li>M'raaj-Dar (Cheydinhal Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary) will no longer repeately be able to resell his unique items as his only merchant container respawned; added a second merchant container to him that doesn't respawn and moved the unique items to it.</li>
<li>After the Path of Dawn (Main Quest) is completed, the two quest-reserved barstools in Luther Broad's Boarding House (IC Elven Gardens) will become usable.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.3.0 - Minor Update (2010-08-29)</p>
<ul>
<li>The level 6-12 version of The Sunken One (SQ07CreatureStormAtronach02) now has the properly assigned skeleton.</li>
<li>The DarkSister topic fix placed the two required voice support files in the wrong folder and has been corrected.</li>
<li>Redid the fix for the fire at Vilverin casting light so that it won't duplicate with lighting mods, and now it produces smoke.</li>
<li>The dock lamp north of Vilverin now casts light.</li>
<li>Laythe Wavrick (Chorrol castle) will no longer lose his essential status at the end of the Canvas the Castle quest, as he is required to complete the Sins of the Father quest as well.</li>
<li>Fixed the CS warnings about path grids with too many connections.</li>
<li>Corrected location reference in stage 10 of the Fighters Guild quest The Wandering Scholar: "Sutch" -> "Anvil" (the town of Sutch was removed before release).</li>
<li>If the player initially declines Fathis Ules' request in Sins of the Father, he will no longer give up asking.</li>
<li>Several rug pieces in cell ChorrolCastlePrivateQuarters were not grounded properly.</li>
<li>The bed in Ocato's chamber has been changed to be owned by the IC Palace faction so Evangeline Beanique will perform her intended sleep package.</li>
<li>AI pack AhMalzFightersGuild changed to a wander pack. The travel pack type had Ah-Malz standing in place.</li>
<li>The replacement columns in the IC Arena have been modified so that mods which may need to move them can do so without requiring the UOP as a dependency.</li>
<li>The rock in the road in SE Anvil has been deleted, and the sidewalk pieces it was covering a hole for pushed down just enough to cover it with the street instead.</li>
<li>Fathis should have slept at The Oak and Crosier between midnight and 9am while Sins of the Father is active. No bed was available though. The spare room has been marked as owned by the Chorrol city faction so he can use it.</li>
<li>Bugak gro-Bol had a schedule conflict that would cut short his wander package, and also caused his meal time to last longer than intended.</li>
<li>Weatherleah could be left in its ruined state for the remainder of the game if the player rushes into Redguard Valley Cave too quickly in "Sins of the Father".</li>
<li>Romana Faleria had two sleep packages which conflicted with each other, and her meal package would not fire. She also has a line of dialogue which was out of order and could never be spoken. She ALSO had an AI pack to confine her in Bruma during Martin's exit to the battlefield, but that would send her back to the IC. This pack has been removed.</li>
<li>If Gromm is killed after "Accidents Happen" his body will no longer vanish instantly.</li>
<li>Aelwin Merowald's House is marked as being owned by the Chestnut Handy Stables faction, which could result in him being killed for trespassing.</li>
<li>Corvus Umbranox cannot use the bed in the royal quarters for his sleep package due to it being owned only by Milona.</li>
<li>Llensi Llaram could not offer athletics training as intended due to being set to auto-calc her stats.</li>
<li>When Didier Aumilie uses the Altar of Stendarr in Anvil's chapel, the blessing will no longer fly across the chapel instead of hitting him.</li>
<li>BravilVisitLuckyOldLady12x2 had impossible conditions to meet, and so would never execute for those NPCs using it. It has been set to execute when "Following A Lead" and "Honor Thy Mother" are not running.</li>
<li>Fathis Aren never sleeps in his bed as he's supposed to due to packages being in the wrong order.</li>
<li>Hans Black-Nail had two conflicting sleep packages.</li>
<li>Henantier's AI schedule had some duplicate packages that would never execute which have been removed.</li>
<li>AI BravilMGItaRienusCastMysticism needs the "must complete" flag or Ita Rienus will not peform the package for the entire specified time.</li>
<li>Daenlin's Sunday hunting package is cut short due to his services package being loaded in the wrong order.</li>
<li>Ranaline had AI packs with conflicting schedules.</li>
<li>Kurdan gro-Dragol could not execute his sleep package due to bed ownership issues.</li>
<li>Camilla Lollia will stalk the player even if "A Plot Revealed" has been completed without encountering her in Bruma.</li>
<li>Selena Orania was not marked essential and if killed before "A Plot Revealed" she would sill show up as a body in the destroyed guild hall.</li>
<li>Naspia Cosma had an AI pack with no useful purpose removed.</li>
<li>AI Pack FGKeldSpar corrected to allow Keld of the Isles to perform his entire schedule as intended.</li>
<li>Trayvond the Redguard could not do training in destruction due to his training level being set to 0.</li>
<li>Uurwen's meal package would never execute due to being in the wrong order.</li>
<li>If the player speaks to Prior Maborel first about assistance, he will offer to let you take his horse but the ownership status is not properly updated.</li>
<li>Eugal Belette has an incorrectly configured wander package. Such packages require a target, using a generic cell causes the NPC to stand in place for the duration.</li>
<li>The XMarkerHeading object used by Honditar's morning practice AI pack had no target data, causing him to shoot over the top of his intended target.</li>
<li>Bothiel's wander package was not configured properly, resulting in here often remaining asleep when she should be awake.</li>
<li>Gaspar Stegine's second reading package and his spell practice package were not executing properly due to a schedule conflict with his sleep package.</li>
<li>Adrian Decanius had conflicting sleep packages.</li>
<li>Dul gro-Shug's meal package moves him out of the King and Queen tavern, where he's intended to spend 6 hours of his day.</li>
<li>Geem Jasaiin's sleep package did not have it's time and duration set.</li>
<li>Winson's arena AI incorrectly had the "must complete" flag set, which caused him to remain there permanently upon his arrival.</li>
<li>Gelephor was not in the Bravil Skooma Den faction and could therefore become permanently stuck in Bravil once he arrived.</li>
<li>Jensine's package to go find Fathis Ules was configured incorrectly and has been fixed. A condition was also added to make sure she doesn't follow him all the way to Chorrol.</li>
<li>Jensine said the goodbye line about Audens Avidius even if "Imperial Corruption" is completed.</li>
<li>Jensine would continue to give her "Who told you that" line after refusing to testify.</li>
<li>Maro Rufus could not execute his wander package in the Arboretum due to his default package being set too high in the order.</li>
<li>Varnado could not execute his worship package at the Temple of the One due to his default package being set too high in the order.</li>
<li>Varnado was a member of the Chorrol Citizens faction with no reason to be in it.</li>
<li>Agarmir could not execute his package to eat at the Tiber Septim Hotel due to it being in the wrong order.</li>
<li>Gemellus Axius had a conflicting wander package blocking his meal package.</li>
<li>Trenus Duronius was not in the Bravil Skooma Den faction and could therefore become permanently stuck in Bravil once he arrived.</li>
<li>Tsavi will stand in one spot upon entering either the Leyawiin Mages Guild or the Leyawiin Chapel Hall due to misconfigured wander packages.</li>
<li>A useless package was removed from Tsavi's schedule.</li>
<li>AI pack LeyawiinExploreThreeSisters20x4 was misconfigured as a travel package instead of a wander package.</li>
<li>AI pack LeyawiinChapelHallExplore incorrectly had the "Continue if PC Near" flag set.</li>
<li>Janus Hassildor will no longer block dialogue near the end of "Ulterior Motives" if the player speaks to him again before completing the quest.</li>
<li>Maglir would continue to follow the player even if expelled from the Fighters Guild during "Den of Thieves".</li>
<li>Vigge the Cautious had a schedule conflict keeping him from performing his chapel wander package.</li>
<li>Marie Palielle could not execute her wander package due to it being out of order.</li>
<li>Marie Palielle had a misconfigured package inside the Skingrad chapel.</li>
<li>Agnete the Pickled had a scheduling conflict that blocked her wander package from executing.</li>
<li>Falanu Hlaalu had a scheduling conflict preventing her from performing her daily worship routine in the chapel.</li>
<li>Ambroise Canne's AI packs directing him to work in the Surilie Brothers' yard had two problems: 1) He was unable to equip the rake. 2) He was not offering training services.</li>
<li>Bernadette Peneles would be seen raking the path in Tamika's yard instead of the grass due to the radius on the AI pack being too large.</li>
<li>Davide Surilie's morning work package was an hour too short, causing him to always leave for home to eat lunch rather than eat in the vineyard, assuming it isn't raining.</li>
<li>Else God-Hater has a room and bed marked as hers, but her AI pack did not have her using it. She would therefore sleep in whatever random bed was convenient.</li>
<li>Eyja's eat package after moving to Rosethorn Hall and her market wander package were both improperly set up as find packages, causing them to fail.</li>
<li>Undena Orethi had scheduling conflicts between her work package and sleep package, as well as no location being set on her noon time eat package.</li>
<li>A useless travel package has also been removed from Undena Orethi's schedule.</li>
<li>Sakeepa's entire herd will follow him as intended during his sheep herding package.</li>
<li>The door to Hanz gro-Hubrag's house in Blankenmarch was not owned by him.</li>
<li>The door to Philip Franc's house in Blankenmarch was not owned by him.</li>
<li>Slight bit of furniture rearrangement in Ri'Bassa's house to allow space to turn the single bed into a double so both NPCs who live there can execute their sleep packages.</li>
<li>Ferrum's meal package could not execute due to an impossible set of conditions.</li>
<li>Schlera Sestius' wander package was in the wrong position, blocking both of her other packages. She also lacked a key to get into the room she should sleep in.</li>
<li>Davela Hlaren's bed rental dialogue used the wrong condition check to see if the player had the money to pay.</li>
<li>A rumor about how the Fighters Guild raided a family tomb could be given even if the player never actually raids the tomb in "Amelion's Debt".</li>
<li>Stage 40 in "Mystery at Harlun's Watch" could trigger incorrectly in one of the log entries if only 14 of the required 15 trolls were killed, which throws off other dialogue in the quest, making it impossible to finish.</li>
<li>A rumor about a cover up involving the Fallen Rock Cave contract would circulate even if the player told Modryn Oreyn the truth about what happened.</li>
<li>In Forsaken Mine, if the player visits before "Trolls of Forsaken Mine" and does not return until after the cell resets, all of the bodies which should be visible will have been removed. If this has already happened in the game, this fix cannot undo that, but it will prevent it from happening if the player has not yet visited the dungeon.</li>
<li>In "The Hist" it was possible to get expelled from the Fighters Guild if the player attacked Maglir before he spoke.</li>
<li>Erthor will continue to follow the player if he is expelled from the Mages Guild while escorting him back to Skingrad.</li>
<li>During "The Bloodworm Helm" it is possible to outdistance the entrance to Fort Teleman which will cause the stage 20 update to fail, leaving the quest marker pointing to the exit instead of the location of Irlav's body. The GetDistance check has been replaced with a trigger zone just inside the fort entry, which is more reliable. The body also would remain after the quest was completed and not be removed on cell respawn.</li>
<li>During "Arrow of Extrication" quest markers for going to Bravil would still point to the beggars even if they were dead.</li>
<li>Arrving outside Gweden Farm before 11pm during "The Siren's Deception" will trigger both journal entries for stage 50 due to an incorrect comparison operator being used.</li>
<li>Two paintings in the Bruma player house were never enabled after purchasing the Upper Wall Hangings upgrade. The receipt for this upgrade will also reflect the proper quantity of paintings, which was wrong either way.</li>
<li>When first entering the painted forest in "A Brush with Death" it could be possible for Rythe to fail to initiate his greeting to the player. This has been fixed by removing the distance check on his script so he will peform it regardless of how far away from the player he is. This could have been due to his AI pack having a radius large enough to pull him away from the entry point.</li>
<li>It was possible to hire Eyja as your house servant even if you didn't have enough gold to pay the cost.</li>
<li>Even if you could not afford to rent the bed at Imperial Bridge Inn, you'd still have gold deducted from you and the room would still be made available.</li>
<li>On board the Sea Tub Clarabella, there is a note that is part of an unjournaled quest, written by First Mate Filtch. This note cannot be picked up if dropped.</li>
<li>If the player has joined the Mages Guild and is then expelled before "The Path of Dawn", Tar-Meena will not be in the Arcane University lobby and thus unavailable to complete the quest.</li>
<li>When renting a room from Shuravi, though you still must have enough gold on you to get the "Yes" option, none will actually be subtracted from your total if you accept.</li>
<li>When renting a room from Andreas Draconis, you could get away with paying as little as 10 gold for her 20 gold room due to a faulty dialogue condition.</li>
<li>AngaWallSwitch01SCRIPT does not contain an OnReset block, so the switch governed by it will not reset with the rest of the cell.</li>
<li>A welkynd stone inside level 2 of Hame was set a ridiculous distance outside the playable area and has been moved to where it can be retreived.</li>
<li>If the book "Cleansing of the Fane" is picked up and in the player's inventory before "Nothing You Can Possess" gets started, the player cannot trigger one of the quest stages by reading the book from their inventory due to the book's script having no OnEquip block to do this.</li>
<li>One of the benches in Fort Nikel would trap the player inside a pillar if sat on.</li>
<li>All of Ancotar's items outside at Fort Caractacus were marked as owned by Fathis Aren.</li>
<li>Seridur does not have vampire dust on him when he dies.</li>
<li>If the player spoke to Ralsa Norvalo after starting "Canvas the Castle" she would act as though you had come back to reconsider taking up "The Order of the Virtuous Blood" due to the dialogue condition checking the wrong quest.</li>
<li>The cooking plank at Crestbridge Camp is left behind when the rest of the camp is dismantled.</li>
<li>The arena betting formula that takes the player's luck into account had some glitches in it causing the bonus health to not be applied if luck was either 99 or > 100.</li>
<li>The Descendent and Subjacent versions of the Shock damage/Resist shock sigil stones have now been fully corrected to fit the pattern of the other stones of the same type.</li>
<li>If the legion patrol that comes to your aid during "The Battle for Castle Kvatch" manages to survive the whole battle, they will stand around in the chapel with their swords drawn forever.</li>
<li>Meshes\dungeons\ayleidruins\interior\arwhallironwork01.nif had no collision for the bars on the top half.</li>
<li>The normal maps for the sand used in the Arena did not match their textures.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.2.10 - Minor Update (2010-??-??)</p>
<ul>
<li>MS08AleronLocheScript has invalid syntax.</li>
<li>LeyawiinGuardCityPatrolDay01 and LeyawiinGuardCityPatrolNight01 are both missing the LeyawiinGuardPatrolBeginPatrol package. Without this, these two guards will abandon their patrol routes in the city.</li>
<li>Meshes provided by the Supplemental have been passed through PyFFI again to pick up on updated optimizations.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.2.9 - Minor Update (2010-??-??)</p>
<ul>
<li>The recently replaced Mara statue in Bravil is floating above the pedestal. Oops.</li>
<li>TG10UOPAlreadyFoundBoots somehow got attached to "Sins of the Father" in addition to its normal spot in the Thieves' Guild quest line.</li>
<li>With the same topic edit issue, the actual INFO record that was to be edited got marked as a deletion by the CS, which completely breaks the dialogue for the quest.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.2.8 - Minor Update (2010-??-??)</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a mismatched subtitle for Fathes Ules' dialogue describing Albert Jemane.</li>
<li>Reverted the activation of the Gottshaw Inn legion patrol due to significant numbers of crash reports near Kvatch. Kvatch appears to be a highly sensitive area.</li>
<li>The Zenithar statue in Bravil should be a Mara statue.</li>
<li>North Marker in the Anvil Smuggler's Cave was pointed the wrong direction.</li>
<li>Meshes\Clothes\Upperclass\UOPAdamusPhillidaSeveredFingerHands.NIF is missing from the main UOP 3.2.0 download and is needed for a prior fix.</li>
<li>Changed how the Anvil cathedral and cloister VWD fix was handled so that it can be made more compatible with mods.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.2.7 - Minor Update (2010-??-??)</p>
<ul>
<li>LpGhostFrostDamageTarget was not immune to silence as the other ghost powers are.</li>
<li>LpGhostAncientFrostDamageTouch had incorrect target+self settings when both effects should have been set for touch.</li>
<li>The scripts for the individual shrines for the Divines still had the bug that was fixed for the Nine Divines altars in the chapels.</li>
<li>M'aiq the Liar's AI packages have been altered to remove the "find calipers" package due to strong evidence it leads to crashes near Kvatch.</li>
<li>AI pack ICWaterfrontGuardNightSleep8x8 was set to sleep at 8PM when it is clear by the other packages on the guard that it should have been 8AM.</li>
<li>A dialogue condition error in MS10 (Corruption and Conscience) made it possible to repeatedly be offered the key to Ulrich's quarters.</li>
<li>Another dialogue condition error in MS10 made it possible if timed right to receive the reward for turning Ulrich's evidence in repeatedly.</li>
<li>Removed the script and activator name from the Clavicus Vile shrine's dog piece due to the scripts not synchronizing their data.</li>
<li>Oghma Infinium quest item flag has been restored, and the player prevented from reading the book until after an artifact choice is made on what to give Martin during Blood of the Daedra.</li>
<li>Fast travel was not restored properly after completing Caught in the Hunt.</li>
<li>Two of the keys in Caught in the Hunt had improper scripts assigned to them which might have contributed to quest stages being triggered out of sequence.</li>
<li>Corrected positioning on a blood decal that was clipping in Empty Mine.</li>
<li>Several bridge pieces inside Fort Farragut were sticking out too far, allowing you to see through their undersides.</li>
<li>Maeva the Buxom's bed at Whitmond Farm was not marked as owned by her.</li>
<li>In the book "Modern Heretics", Volendrung is described as a sword when it is and always has been a hammer.</li>
<li>The topic DarkSister was moved from "A Knife in the Dark" to the generic Dark Brotherhood dialogue topic due to it never being available despite being explicitly added to the player's topics.</li>
<li>Linked HaderusGoldwineTopic up to the Kvatch siege quest, Bethesda had already recorded voice files.</li>
<li>Linked the unused Kvatch responses up so Bogond in Chorrol will speak them.</li>
<li>Hitting the Gray Prince outside of the Arena would still generate crowd noises.</li>
<li>ElvenStatueScript fix originally provided did not properly handle leaving and returning to the cell the statues are in.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.2.6 - Minor Update (2010-??-??)</p>
<ul>
<li>The level 5-9 bonus reward for "The Assassinated Man" was missing from the Dark05RewardHeart leveled list.</li>
<li>When adding the Blackwood Company's dog to the cell, I forgot to edit the dog itself to drop its aggression values to keep it from attacking the player unprovoked.</li>
<li>Four dialogue conditions in "The Elven Maiden" were set wrong and could cause the game to skip the theft of the bust in Cheydinhal.</li>
<li>The dead guard outside the Oblivion gate east of Leyawiin was flagged as respawn, which caused him to eventually resurrect. This is undesirable because his face is distorted and remains that way after he respawns.</li>
<li>underwaterseaweed02.nif was missing a stencil property, causing it to be invisible when viewed from the wrong side.</li>
<li>Fixed middletable01.nif so it does not vanish off screen when viewed at odd angles.</li>
<li>Corrected a remaining flaw in the MS94 script that controls the Fort Sutch Oblivion gate.</li>
<li>The door to Harborside Warehouse in Anvil was not owned by the proper faction which could sometimes get Wilhelm the Worm killed for trespassing.</li>
<li>Some of the Rumare Slaughterfish spawns are not disabled properly which can lead to the "Go Fish" quest incorrectly updating stages if the player picks up the scales from the corpses. This will then cause other stages to misfire, leading to the quest not enabling new targets when it should.</li>
<li>Building meshes corrected since 3.2.0 are now AWLS compatible.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.2.5 - Minor Update (2010-??-??)</p>
<ul>
<li>LowerclassPants08 had no female ground mesh (Meshes\Clothes\Lowerclass\08\F\Pants_gnd.NIF).</li>

<li>sewerroomwallmid01.nif had no collision applied.</li>
<li>Clipping issue in chorrolmguildwallupper02.nif fixed by Brumbek.</li>
<li>Magra gro-Naybek will now eat between 6pm and 8pm so that he is available before the shop closes for business.</li>
<li>Gave Fadus Calidius some clothing so he won't be running around his guild hall naked.</li>
<li>Removed the quest item flag from the Southern Books key. If pickpocketed, this will allow the player to drop it if it isn't wanted anymore.</li>
<li>DABoethiaCageOpenScript01 contained an extra endif which makes the script syntactically invalid.</li>
<li>MG09Script contained an extra endif, and a typo after another one that invalidated the script syntax.</li>
<li>MG19ChestScript contained an extra endif which makes the script syntactically invalid.</li>
<li>RufioDie_Script contained an extra endif which makes the script syntactically invalid.</li>
<li>ThumperZ has provided a more streamlined version of the AltaroftheNine script.</li>
<li>The easy version of an Azhklan Troll had no troll fat in its inventory like the other versions do.</li>
<li>The easy version of a Kalperklan Troll had no troll fat in its inventory like the other versions do.</li>
<li>The DBEnWeapBladeWoe10 enchantment had fortify magicka instead of damage magicka like all of the other versions.</li>

<li>LL0LootArrow3SilverAbsorbMagic75 was listed twice in LL1NPCArrowMagic100 but had only been removed once.</li>

<li>Fixed Shepherd's Pie making a different Cure Disease potion at Master-level Alchemy than other ingredients.</li>
<li>Mirabelle Monet sleeps around, as intended, rather than almost always with Thurindil.</li>
<li>Timothee LaRouche sleeps earlier to avoid three-in-a-bed scenario.</li>
<li>Enilroth now puts gold in barrel along with dead drop note.</li>
<li>Set ownership of Varon Vamori's bedroom door so he can get out!</li>
<li>Fixed Gromm telling the player they "do NOT belong in here" while outside or at Olav's.</li>
<li>Jeanne Frasoric no longer wanders after going to sleep.</li>

<li>Gundalas' schedule fixed so he will sleep.</li>
<li>Path grid in Leyawiin Best Goods And Guarantees was missing a node connection to the upstairs area.</li>
<li>Tweaked pathing in Mages' Guild 2nd Floor West so Agata doesn't try to walk through the bench or walls in her room.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with Wumeek where he was unable to meet up with Weebam-Na as he should have.</li>
<li>Kantav Cheynoslin no longer gets up to wander the chapel after he goes to bed.</li>
<li>Dion will now execute his Skingrad explore package properly.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.2.4 - Minor Update (2010-??-??)</p>
<ul>
<li>The path grid in Hackdirt Caverns was seriously messed up.</li>
<li>castlesecretblack01.nif has been reverted back to the vanilla version of the mesh, which actually DOES block secret areas from showing up on the map. The UOP version of this mesh fails to do this in a fairly substantial way, which leads to cell maps showing things that shouldn't be revealed until discovered.</li>
<li>Corrected a broken ROAD node link on the path from Weye to Chorrol which caused NPCs to unnecessarily use the mountain road instead.</li>
<li>Corrected a broken ROAD node link east of Pell's Gate that caused NPCs to unnecessarily traverse the northern route around the Imperial Isle even when the southern one was shorter.</li>
<li>Corrected yet another ROAD node link that was severed over the bridge at the SE outlet to Lake Rumare.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.2.3a - Hotfix Update (2010-??-??)</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed the resistance additions for boars and imps due to *ahem* "popular demand".</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.2.3 - Minor Update (2010-??-??)</p>
<ul>
<li>A section of path grid was missing from the SE Imperial Sewer tunnel.</li>
<li>The script SewerVerticalGate01SCRIPT immproperly unlinked path nodes from open sewer gates due to not checking the state of the gate prior to doing so.</li>
<li>EncArrow4DwarvenFireDamageLight, Arrow4Dwarven, EncArrow4DwarvenSilence, EncArrow4DwarvenFireDamage, EncArrow4DwarvenFrostDamage, EncArrow4DwarvenShockDamage, and EncArrow4DwarvenFrostArea are all incorrectly pointing to the menu icon for iron arrows which Bethesda included but apparently never uses.</li>
<li>The chest in the tutorial dungeon containing the rusty iron armor was missing a pair of rusty iron gauntlets.</li>
<li>The skeleton in the tutorial dungeon with the rough leather gear was missing the helmet and gloves.</li>
<li>Regular imps have been given their expected 50% resistance to magic.</li>
<li>Boars in the game have been given their expected 25% resistance to magic.</li>
<li>Imps in Camoran's Paradise were missing their expected magic resistance and water walking abilities.</li>
<li>Blood and mana fountains in Oblivion planes should no longer fail to have their affect on you due to reflection and/or absorbtion abilities.</li>
<li>Favor of Akatosh restoration will no longer fail due to reflection and/or absorbtion.</li>
<li>Altar of Zenithar script was incorrectly casting the Akatosh altar spell on NPCs who activate the altar.</li>
<li>Rotated obcavefloor2lava_n.dds 180 degrees to align it properly with it's regular texture file and glowmap.</li>
<li>Path grid around the Knights of the Thorn house had issues with trying to pass through walls.</li>
<li>LOD meshes for Boethia's statue and shrine have been optimized properly. They were full size copies of the real meshes.</li>
<li>City wall sections in SW Cheydinhal have been restored that went missing somehow in the previous update.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.2.2 - Minor Update (2009-??-??)</p>
<ul>
<li>Dar-Ma's horse will move to the corral at the Chorrol stables after the Hackdirt quest involving her is over.</li>
<li>Picking up the pipes in the Hist room in the Blackwood Company will no longer count as theft.</li>
<li>Fixed ownership on the silver dagger in the Dagon Shrine so it won't count as theft.</li>
<li>Reverted a rock edit in 21,11 that left 3 smaller ones above it floating free.</li>
<li>Redid the method of substitution for the torch lights on the Skingrad Castle bridge so as not to interfere with lighting mods and cause performance issues.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.2.1 - Minor Update (2009-??-??)</p>
<ul>
<li>A bug where closing the Fort Sutch oblivion gates before completing Allies for Bruma would cause any city gates which remained open to revert to their original states with no signs that they had ever been opened. Wreckage from closed gates would also disappear. This would break the Allies for Bruma quest making it impossible to complete.</li>
<li>Removed "War Axe of Sapping" from the LL0NPCWeapon0MagicWarhammerLvl100 as it is not a warhammer like all the others.</li>
<li>Added AI pack SkingradGunderExplore4x2 to Gunder in Skingrad so he will perform his city exploration as intended.</li>
<li>Added AI pack UOPGanredhelDogsFollow4x2 to Ganredhel's dogs so they will follow as they're supposed to when Ganredhel walks them.</li>
<li>Numerous AI packs have been adjusted to use the proper types and durations where needed.</li>
<li>The script for the Skingrad Mages Recommendation quest was adjusted to more properly count the number of zombies killed. Taken from TIE's reworked script.</li>
<li>Position of a rock, 000ABC39, in Blackwood has been corrected to cover up the cell boundary between 30,-41 and 30,-40.</li>
<li>Map marker for Red Lane Camp had no map data attached.</li>
<li>Map marker for Two Decker Camp had no map data attached.</li>
<li>Map marker for Leyawiin West Gate had no map data attached.</li>
<li>Scripts 'streetlightscript' and 'ExteriorLightScript' have been optimized to reduce FPS hits from repeatedtly enabling/disabling light sources.</li>
<li>meshes\architecture\castle\CastleWallRiverGate01.NIF was missing one of the crenels on the top and has been fixed.</li>
<li>Open Cities compatibility script has been removed and replaced with a script-less solution using the "rock" method described in the Open Cities documentation.</li>
<li>Fixed a couple of bugs in the ROAD record.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.2.0 (2008-08-28)</p>
<b>UOP Changes/Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Reoptimized 932 of the 1,207 NIF meshes already in the UOP to eliminate FPS hit on some of them that seems to have been introduced by the old PyFFI NIFOptimize spell; the new one shapifies strip blocks if the average strip length is less than 10 and eliminates the problem; many of the meshes (also due to much manual optimization) now provide better FPS than the stock ones</li>
<li>Fixed accidental conversion of purple Primroses into pink ones ( FloraPrimrosePurple.NIF )</li>
<li>Added "UOP" prefix to UOP-added meshes ClubStatic.NIF, DunBenchNormal.NIF, Note01Static.NIF and Cheese05Static.NIF and changed their object definitions in the ESP appropriately so it can be determined where they came from</li>
<li>Removed the harmless water height of -2147483648.000000 from some interior cell headers in the UOP added by a bug in TESCS; it only appears when water is disabled so will cause no problems unless a mod enables water in the cell and water heights are merged in Wrye Bash</li>
<li>Moved the rocks in Rockmilk Haven covering where the new load door was added so that if it doesn't appear on an existing game there isn't a gap</li>
</ul>

<b>NPC and Quest Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed (yet another) conflict involving Through a Nightmare Darkly (Bravil) where the player couldn't join the Mages' Guild after talking to Kud-Ei about the quest even when they weren't ready to help and she was still in the guildhall; the topic will now only become unavailable when the player agrees to follow her to Henantier's house</li>
<li>Fixed conditions on yet another line of dialog (from Battlemages) so the player will no longer be called "the Arcane University's newest addition" if they are the Arch-Mage</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p class="h">v3.1.0 (2008-08-16)</p>
<b>UOP Changes/Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Integrated the COBL common menuing system (on first load you'll have a weightless "Unofficial Oblivion Patch" misc. item with a key icon added, which isn't a quest item so you can drop if you don't want it, so there are now three ways to open the UOP menu: <b>startquest uop</b> in the console, equip the item, or if you have COBL active it will go into the common menu)</li>
<li>Added a set of Bash tags to the UOP ESP so that fixes (such as cell ownership, the nVidia black screen fix, item stats, levelled lists, etc.) can be preserved from overwriting by later-loaded mods by creating a Bashed Patch</li>
<li>Added options to the UOP menu to disable the Trespasses misc. stat fix just in case another mod has renamed the formerly useless stat. to something else and is using it, and to remove/readd the Fast-Travel Follower Double-Face fix spell in case the player doesn't want it in their spell list (see below)</li>
<li>Improved the fix for the conflict between the Bravil Recommendation and Through a Nightmare Darkly quests due to Kud-Ei being the questgiver for both; removed conflicts so that both quests can run simultaneously without errors</li>
<li>Removed all changes including the cell header for Tamriel cells (16,13) and (20,-17) due to a few reports of the engine glitching and failing to render the land there (would go away by saving/quitting/reloading; all Tamriel edits to the land itself were already removed previously)</li>
<li>Hardcoded the Rumare Slaughterfish spawn points for the Go Fish quest in case the player has installed landscape mods that move them so they don't end up embedded again</li>
<li>Removed/replaced/recompiled the fixed script WabbajackSpellEffect replacing a deleted (now useless) ref. variable so that it doesn't show as a critical conflict in TES4Vew/Edit</li>
<li>Removed the fix for leading spaces in several cave entrance meshes; for some reason (currently unknown) the meshes were missing from several people's folders though they are properly named/placed by the installer/7-Zip (folder is Data\Meshes\Dungeons\Caves\Exterior); possibly something else is removing them so original filenames will be restored so if the meshes are missing then it will fall back to the BSA's (will keep the fixed meshes as optimized 100KB off of them and one of them has a fix for it going invisible if the texture changes)</li>
<li>Fixed the filename on JMRockSnow04.NIF (was somehow renamed to JMRockSnowSmall04.NIF) so the fixed mesh wasn't appearing (had bad UV mapping on one area; also the existing file had a bad texture path from an old NIFSkope bug so redid the fix from scratch)</li>
<li>Fixed the filename on RockGreatForest1400FGDRMoss.NIF (was somehow renamed to RockGreatForest1400FGDMoss.NIF) so the fixed mesh wasn't appearing (had a small piece of bad UV mapping)</li>
<li>Fixed face-optimize introduced "wobbly" UV mapping on the brickwork behind the Forge in the Chorrol Fighter's Guild basement ( ChorrolFGInterior01Basement.NIF ) and on house exterior ChorrolHouseUpper03.NIF</li>
<li>Restored a missing polygon over the stairway of ChorrolHouseMiddle06Interior.NIF (rare instance of exporter error)</li>
<li>Restored missing vertex colors to MainDeck01.NIF (deck planking could be seen through hatchway lattice)</li>
<li>Fixed slightly wobbly/stretched face-optimize introduced UV mapping on the roofs of ChorrolHouseMiddle09.NIF, ChorrolMageGuild01.NIF and LeyawiinHouseLower03.NIF</li>
<li>Fixed optimizing in ICGroundFloor03.NIF causing a ragged edge on the local map, and optimized a further 2KB off of it</li>
<li>Fixed a flickering polygon over the basement door of the Bravil Fighters' Guild main floor ( BravilFightersGuildInt1stFloor.NIF ) caused by optimize artifacting; also closed a seethrough gap over the same door that was missed originally</li>
<li>Fixed a polygon of bad UV mapping on the Anvil boardwalk ( AnvilBoardwalkChunk01.NIF ); optimize artifacting again</li>
<li>Restored polygons on AnvilHouseMCInterior01.NIF that caused seethrough gaps when addon AnvilMCinteriorBackDoor01 was used (also fixed that there was one large gap even in the original mesh in this situation)</li>
<li>Fixed a flickering polygon in the ceiling of ChorrolHouseUpper03Interior.NIF; optimize artifacting yet again</li>
<li>Fixed three unlighted windows in the top floor of the Skingrad Mages' Guild ( SkMageGuildIntT.NIF ) due to optimize vertex color stretching</li>
<li>Restored two accidentally deleted beam polygons on SkHouseMiddleInt03.NIF; also closed another seethrough gap in a beam and eliminated a flickering overlap</li>
<li>Restored an accidentally deleted polygon in the middle floor of SKHouseMiddleInt02.NIF which left a hole under a window</li>
<li>Restored an accidentally deleted polygon in beam of SKHouseUpperInt06.NIF; also fixed one of the ceiling support beams not reaching the opposite wall</li>
<li>Restored an accidentally deleted polygon in a beam of SKFightersGuildIntT.NIF</li>
<li>Restored an accidentally deleted polygon in the stairway of BrumaHouseUpper01Int.NIF</li>
<li>Fixed overly dark vertex colors on the hay archery target ( TargetHay01.NIF ) due to smoothing modifier on the target faces; mesh unfortunately grew by 16KB but it's still less than half the original size</li>
</ul>

<b>NPC and Quest Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an occasional timing bug with the Boethiah Tournament of Ten Bloods where the opponent Chosen would remain standing around the player's arrival cage even if the player wasn't using a custom race (if this happens as soon as the player opens the cage door the Chosen will all go to where they should be)</li>
<li>Fixed Martin's spellcasting during battles occasionally resulting in him getting a bounty if he hit an ally which would result in him constantly being attacked by guards; his bounty will now be cleared periodically when the Find the Heir, Weynon Priory and Light the Dragonfires quests are running (when the player is escorting him)</li>
<li>If the player fails either Malacath's or Namira's shrine quests, this will no longer prevent Hermaeus Mora's quest from starting once all the other shrine quests are completed (will also fix existing saves; also fixed that Shobob gro-Rugdush would remain essential for the rest of the game if Malacath's quest was failed: all other shrine quests make the questgiver unessential if failed)</li>
<li>Fixed the Namira shrine quest not awarding a Fame point on successful completion as all the other shrine quests do (will also apply it retroactively if the quest was already completed)</li>
<li>Fixed Hundolin's (IC Arena bookie) Aggression being too high, so he would sometimes attack the player without provocation, which could break the Arena questline (if the player had a bet placed, they could no longer compete)</li>
<li>Finally corrected Arena Grand Champion Agronak gro-Malog's level being fixed at 10 making for a very anticlimactic battle for a high-level player, rather than being offset 10 levels higher than the player which falls into the progression of all the other Arena combatants</li>
<li>Fixed bug with the Mages Guild Skingrad Recommendation where Erthor would refuse to leave indicating that there were still zombies though they were all dead making the questline unfinishable if the player killed one or more zombies, left Bleak Flats and returned after it had respawned, and killed two of the new ones within a five second interval</li>
<li>Fixed the Swampy Cave trolls in the Fighter's Guild quest Mystery at Harlun's Watch being able to go outside the cave and having no AI, so if they followed the player outside they could randomly run off into the wilderness which broke the questline</li>
<li>In the Fighter's Guild Information Gathering quest, knocking out Ajum-Kajin (power attack, Paralyze effect, fatigue drain, etc.) will no longer prevent him from sitting back down again or sometimes from being able to talk at all</li>
<li>In the Fighter's Guild quests Amelion's Debt and Mystery at Harlun's Watch, Biene Amelion's house in Water's Edge and Drarana Thelas' house in Harlun's Watch will no longer be trespass zones when the player is supposed to meet them to continue the quests</li>
<li>Fixed the allies in the Breaking the Siege of Kvatch and Battle for Castle Kvatch quests being weak on defense because they wear light Kvatch Cuirasses but were members of classes (Kvatch Soldier and Warrior) with no Light Armor skill; changed the unneeded Sneak skill (was copied from the Guard class) in the Kvatch Soldier class to Light Armor, and changed Berich Inian and Tierra's classes from Warrior to Kvatch Soldier</li>
<li>Also fixed all the Defense of Bruma/Great Gate soldiers from Allies for Bruma towns also being Warrior class but wearing light armor; they are now members of the modified Kvatch Soldier class</li>
<li>After the Imperial Corruption quest, Audens Avidius attacking the player will no longer result in the player getting an assault bounty and being attacked by guards if there are any in the area at the time (this should also fix the bug where Audens is still able to arrest the player after he's been imprisoned and stripped of his rank)</li>
<li>In the Spies quest, fixed Jearl's death at the player's hands being counted as a murder if she didn't attack first (ie backstab, sleeping, etc.) as her factions weren't being updated, fixed the load door of her house not changing ownership so the player could still be arrested for entering though Burd indicates otherwise and cleared the ownership of her house so that the player isn't trespassing and doesn't increase Items Stolen picking up items there though they don't show a theft icon</li>
<li>In the Secrets of the Ayleids quest, fixed overly difficult Skeleton Guardians appearing in Nenalata for level 1-4 players due to an error in levelled list MS27LL1UndeadBones100</li>
<li>After the Path of Dawn quest, when Baurus is back at Cloud Ruler Temple he won't indicate that he's providing free training (increases the player's Blade, Block and Heavy Armor skills) if he isn't; only provides the increase if one or more of these skills are under 90</li>
<li>Fixed Alawen (Marksman master trainer) not agreeing to train if the player had two or more Elven Bows in their inventory (player needs an Elven bow as a prerequisite)</li>
<li>Corrected oversight in the Canvas the Castle quest where if the stolen painting was returned to the Countess, it never reappeared on the wall in her chambers as it should have</li>
<li>Corrected minor oversight where the poison and/or medicine persisted in the medicine cabinet after the Dark Brotherhood's Bad Medicine quest even though it had supposedly been removed and given to Roderick</li>
<li>Fixed the opened crate in the Maria Elena that the player hides in for the Dark Brotherhood quest A Watery Grave being there before this event happened</li>
<li>Fixed Lord Lovidicus (Origin of the Gray Prince quest) not being able to infect the player with Porphyric Hemophilia though he's a full-fledged vampire (had already corrected his not dropping Vampire Dust)</li>
<li>Fixed Kurz gro-Baroth's sleep package having no location, so he could be found sleeping on beggar's bedrolls outdoors rather than in the Chorrol Fighters' Guild</li>
<li>Fixed Eyja (Skingrad, Colovian Traders) never sleeping if not hired at Rosethorn Manor as the cell and bed were owned by Gunder; added faction for them and set ownership to that (she actually indicates if she's hired that she shared Gunder's bed)</li>
<li>Fixed Undena Orethi (Skingrad) never reaching her tomato patch because the marker for it was buried in a boulder in a cliff face by the Gold Road in a different cell; also gave her a hoe and changed her AI so that she'll use it at the right place</li>
<li>Added the missing Hackdirt Key to Natch Pinder, Jiv Hiriel and Marlena Brussiner</li>
<li>Added missing castle keys to one of the Skingrad Castle guards</li>
<li>Added Jair's (IC Waterfront) missing key to his inventory</li>
<li>Gave Roderic Pierrane a copy of Metrick's House Key so that he isn't stuck outside her locked house when he visits her</li>
<li>Gave Manheim Maulhand (Inn of Ill Omen publican) a pair of pants as he only had greaves and publican duty removes armor, so he had nothing on below the waist</li>
<li>Gave a Bruma night patrol guard his missing pants, and a Chorrol Castle night guard pants, shirt and shoes as they were missing (though they would usually sleep in their armor)</li>
<li>Fixed one of the "thieves" in the Fighter's Guild Den of Thieves quest sometimes having no pants (missing greaves) whereas their ally had multiple sets</li>
<li>Gave the Imperial Legion Soldier at the Gottshaw Inn his missing helmet</li>
<li>Removed one of the night Battlemages' (IC Arcane University) shields as none of the others have one</li>
<li>Fixed a Leyawiin City Watch having a Silver Shortsword, whereas every other Imperial officer in the land has a longsword</li>
<li>Myvryna Arano will no longer use the "I've been looking for you." greeting when she hasn't been (only should be used when the player has been released from prison and she is delivering the note)</li>
<li>Imperial Legion members will no longer use the "murdering bastard" greeting on the player if the player's Infamy is one or less and the player is not a member of the Dark Brotherhood (the IsPCAMurdererFlag flag this checks can be set by accidentally hitting an ally in combat and then can't be cleared by any means without OBSE)</li>
<li>Fixed conditions on a Mages' Guild rumor so that Hannibal Traven doesn't talk about himself in the third-person</li>
<li>Fixed Burz gro-Khash and Mazoga the Orc not unequipping weapons/shields when eating, so they would go right through the table</li>
<li>Fixed the rumor that Vidkun (Cheydinhal Mages Guild Recommendation) hasn't been seen around town recently only appearing in Skingrad</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Added a spell (will appear in Lesser Powers on load or a new game) to fix the "double-face" bug where NPC followers of the player have two faces (their headgear is also duplicated) after fast-travelling; simply cast the spell on an affected follower to fix them (spell is a Lesser Power so that it stands out from the other spells and doesn't train the spell skill, it doesn't use any magicka, can be cast if silenced and won't be considered hostile; checks are in place to prevent it from being cast on invalid targets ie non-following NPC's but it may still work on others, so randomly casting it on everyone isn't advised; if you don't want the spell it can be removed or put back again with the UOP menu)</li>
<li>Finally got around to changing the default icon for script effect spells, which were inexplicably using the confusing "Burden" ball-and-chain; changed to use the much more appropriate "Generic Magic" icon as script effects can do anything</li>
<li>Fixed the "Trespasses" misc. stat. on the player stats. sheet never updating; it will now update if the player trespasses in an owned cell and remains for 3-6 seconds (also it should avoid updating if the cell becomes a trespass zone due to NPC package change while the player is there if the Continue If Player Near flag is not set; this fix can be toggled off with the UOP menu - see above in UOP Changes)</li>
<li>Fixed an entire cell of Rockmilk cave (RockmilkCave02) being inaccessible as it had no connection to other cells; cell was completely developed with no errors and all that was required was to change its name from "Rockmilk Haven" to "Rockmilk - Bandit Lair" (as there already is a "Rockmilk Haven"; new name matches a similar cell in Charcoal Cave), add a linked door to Rockmilk Haven and replace some of the levelled melee bandits with missile bandits for variety as they were all the same</li>
<li>Added a new ROAD record for the Tamriel worldspace which fixes redundant node connections and nodes that don't follow the roadways; notably NPC's should no longer try to cut through the Leyawiin Stables buildings/fences, and Shum gro-Yarug and others should no longer fall off of the Skingrad Castle bridge</li>
<li>The player/followers/NPC's should no longer suddenly drop dead in Oblivion Citadel towers (with fire columns) due the instant-death lava being too close to the floor (any slight glitch in the floor Havok would allow the actor to touch the lava); also included SigilLightTowerBase.NIF with the Havok displaced to reflect the changed lava height so that the player can't go for a swim in the swirling lava pool</li>
<li>Similar to the above, fixed the lava height so that the player can't go for a swim in the lava pool (which is supposed to result in instant death; was too low due to the cell being tilted) in the Oblivion citadel cell "Embers of Hatred" (also linked two unlinked pathgrid nodes that were generating warnings)</li>
<li>Corrected the names of all the gate controls in Oblivion random world # 2 "Portals of Natural Disaster" towers (Eruption, Landslide, Tornado and Tsunami) so that they match the gate they open (and the message that appears when it's opened as well)</li>
<li>Fixed the Cheydinhal and Kvatch Oblivion planes' Sigil Stones giving unlimited amounts of Sigil Stones (and Fame points) if repeatedly activated, and the Great Gate quest's Great Sigil Stone doing the same</li>
<li>Fixed the player not being able to use a chapel altar if the last time they used that altar was one week ago (was using the day of the week as the timer variable)</li>
<li>Also fixed the same timer bug as above for the statue of Akatosh in the Temple of the One</li>
<li>Fixed the player's compass being wrong in the following interior cells due to missing direction indicators: the Arena (two of the four), Lost Black Rock Chasm, Lower Breakneck Cave, Breakneck Cave Inner Chamber, J'Ghasta's Secret Training Room (Bruma), Castle Cheydinhal Dungeon, Fingerbowl Cave - Lord Crypt, Fort Ash, Fort Ash Stockade, Fort Rayles Hall of Winter, Trentius Family Mausoleum (IC Palace District), Sewer Waterworks (IC Elven Gardens), Hall of Epochs (IC Palace District sewers, one of two similarly named), Castle Kvatch Passageway, Jeetum-Ze's Room (Blackwood Company, Leyawiin), City Watch Barracks (Leyawiin), Dar Jee's House (Leyawiin), Nagastani Sedorsel, Nenalata Wendesel, The Sleeping Mare (Pell Gate), Redwater Slough, Rock Bottom Caverns, Rockmilk Haven, Rockmilk - Blackbow Camp, Sideways Cave - Hidden Lake, Sideways Cave - Lost Abagarlas, Chapel Hall (Chapel of Julianos, Skingrad), Undena Orethi's House (Skingrad) and Tidewater Cave</li>
<li>Fixed all player-owned horses stuttering when passing corpses due to having corpse checking enabled</li>
<li>Dirtied all instances of CandlestickFloor01DarkFake (floor candlestick with one large red candle) so that they don't all disappear if the player has Shivering Isles (mesh path was incorrect, 1.2 patch caused engine to no longer find it so they showed as error meshes {was already fixed in the UOP}, Bethesda inexplicably deleted them all in the SI ESM rather than correcting the mesh path)</li>
<li>Removed useless empty levelled list LL0LootArrow3SilverAbsorbMagic75 from six other levelled lists so that they don't all get included unnecessarily in Bashed Patches that remove empty lists</li>
<li>Added the missing ownership to the Knights of the Thorn Basement (Cheydinhal) to match the upstairs cell</li>
<li>Corrected invalid target reference on package SkingradDailyWorshipEveningUseAltarDibella (no stock NPC's use this package, but may as well fix it in case mods do and don't correct it)</li>
<li>Corrected the ownership of Floyd Nathans' house's load door (Blankenmarch) as it was owned by Dar Jee of Leyawiin for some reason</li>
<li>Fixed the ownership of Chestnut Handy Stables as it was owned by the Chorrol stables' faction, and set the ownership of the bedrolls similarly as they could be slept in by the player</li>
<li>Fixed the ownership of the publican's and rent beds in Border Watch Inn, Faregyl Inn, Gottshaw Inn, The Sleeping Mare and The Drunken Dragon Inn so that the player can't sleep in them (and for the rent beds can't without paying; left the non-player rent beds where the player needs to break in to get to them)</li>
<li>Fixed the ownership of the bed in Lelles' Quality Mercandise {sic} (Anvil), the jailors' beds and prisoners' bedrolls in the Bravil, Bruma, Cheydinhal , Chorrol and IC dungeons, Black Waterside Stables (Cheydinhal), the Cheydinhal and Chorrol Castle Great Halls, Fire and Steel, Jirolin Doran's house, Malintus Ancrus' house, Rimalus Bruiant's house, Renoit's Books (Chorrol), Hammer and Axe, Nord Winds and Novaroma (Bruma), the Chorrol Fighters' Guild (without being a member), the Arena Bloodworks, the Guard House Private Quarters (IC Elven Gardens district), the Foaming Flask (IC Talos Plaza district), the All Saints' Inn (IC Temple district), the Imperial City Lighthouse (IC Waterfront district), Betto Plotius' house, Margarte's house, Southern Books, Three Sisters Inn and the Fighters' Guild (without being a member) (Leyawiin) and the Skingrad Fighters' and Mages' Guilds (without being a member) and the Town Guard House as they could be slept in by the player</li>
<li>Changed the ownership of a bedroll with a dead bandit on it in Rockmilk Cave so that other residents don't sleep on it and cuddle the corpse</li>
<li>Fixed the ownership of several containers in the Bridge Inn basement and Newlands Lodge (Cheydinhal), and one in Luther Broad's Boarding House Rooms which were player-owned though were not in the player's rented room</li>
<li>Fixed another door in Heinrich Oaken-Hull's house not being tied to his key, Varel Morvayn's not being tied to a door in his shop, and Newheim the Portly's and Jesan Sextius' not being tied to a door in their houses (Anvil)</li>
<li>Fixed the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn Key not being tied to one of the doors in the basement</li>

<b>Placement and Layout Fixes</b>
<ul>

<li>Fixed followers/enemies running into the lava and dying rather than following the player across two bridges to an island in Oblivion random world # 5 as the bridges and island had no pathing whatsoever</li>
<li>Fixed pathgrids in Oblivion random world #1 and #6 towers "Blood Well" that would cause followers to fall to their deaths (the former was missing pathing completely on the spiral ramp and top, and on the latter preferred nodes were under the floor in lava, and about two-thirds of the spiral ramp had no pathing)</li>
<li>Added missing pathgrid nodes in Oblivion random world # 2 tower cell "Corridors of Dark Salvation" near the load door as their being missing was causing followers to disappear when the player went through it</li>
<li>Fixed followers and enemies getting stuck in the sunken citadel tower roof of Oblivion random world # 1 as the edge of the roof was too high to walk over; added two stair blocks appropriate to the pathing</li>
<li>Eliminated a large flickering overlap on one of the bridges to the citadel tower and moved a ground blade to cover a large flickering polygon where the ground met the lava in Oblivion Random World #1</li>
<li>Replaced several instances in ruined forts' crypt and basin alcoves of alcove piece RFHubArchTransNarrow which was ill-fitting, leaving seethrough gaps on the walls and bad flickering overlaps in the ceiling; replaced with slightly larger piece RFHallNHalf01 which fits seamlessly and adjusted nearby objects appropriately</li>
<li>Fixed there only being one bed in Weatherleah, so after the Legacy Lost quest one of the Jemanes would always wander looking for a bed while the other was sleeping; did not have to add a bed as the existing one was duplicated in place with different enable parents on the duplicates, so moved the post-quest bed (moved a chest and crates to make room for it) and deparented the pre-quest one</li>
<li>Fixed the Leyawiin cathedral so that grass isn't growing through the steps and the ground isn't protruding through the mesh (only one LAND resource required and it's not in the Tamriel worldspace so shouldn't cause a problem)</li>
<li>Moved nine instances of StoneWallGateDoor01 (animated wooden small door in stone walls) throughout Cyrodiil as their hinges weren't attached to anything</li>
<li>Grounded a rock in Tamriel cell 38,2 and 33,-5, two in cell 14,31, a Bergamot in 22,5, an Amanita in -19,12, a seethrough-underside tree in 27,-1 and moved a slightly embedded tree in -16,16 missed in the Tamriel audit</li>

<li>Added missing Oblivion Gate enable parent to a levelled Daedric beast that could be found before the gate opened or the main quest was even started, disabled/moved a duplicated-in-place burnt tree missing its Oblivion Gate enable parent so could be seen embedded in the "real" tree and moved a flame mode embedded in a ground blade (the base of the flame could be seen sticking out through the blade) into the burnt tree in Tamriel cell -44,-5</li>
<li>Disabled/moved an unnecesary Oblivion rock wall piece at the gate in Tamriel cell 9,31 as it was completely hollow at one end</li>
<li>Added missing Oblivion Gate enable parents to a large talon rock just outside Bruma (7,34) and a smaller rock (7,35), and a talon rock in (20,0) sticking out through a boulder as they were visible before the gate was opened or the main quest even started</li>
<li>Fixed two boulders in (1,2) not being reverse-parented to their Oblivion Gate, so lava texture showed on the ground before the gate opened (or the main quest started) and they were embedded in gate rocks when it was open</li>
<li>Closed a large seethrough gap in a cave tunnel in The Sightless Grotto in Peryite's realm</li>
<li>Fixed the well bucket rope being visibly attached to nothing and moved a duplicated-in-place Stinkhorn in the tutorial dungeon</li>
<li>Disabled/moved two unnecessary bridge edge components and a duplicated-in-place support on the large bridge over the Niben (14,7) causing flickering</li>
<li>Closed a seethrough-underside part of the exterior Cheydinhal town walls (was fixed previously but came back when land edits were removed)</li>
<li>Grounded Hundolin's noticeably flying Arena Lockbox chest table and moved an unreadable Gray Fox wanted poster trapped in the wall Havok mesh (IC Arena District)</li>
<li>Aligned fifteen misaliged stone wall pieces in Leyawiin that were showing seethrough sections</li>
<li>Grounded a noticeably flying table on the topmost walkway of the Leyawiin Mages' Guild</li>
<li>Moved/scaled/added mine support objects as required to close several seethrough ceiling beams, moved a set of supports to eliminate a large flickering overlap and flipped a gate so that it doesn't embed in the wall when open in Desolate Mine</li>
<li>Moved a hanging lamp in Doomed Mine and another in Exhausted Mine Spent Works so that opening nearby doors won't cause them to fly around madly</li>
<li>Moved a helmet in Empty Mine that had been placed on a skull, but due to Havok would slide right through the skull when the player approached</li>
<li>Raised a burning bookshelf in Exhausted Mine Bottom Section embedded in rock and a skeleton</li>
<li>Moved a barrel in Haunted Mine deeply embedded in a support beam</li>

<li>Flipped the load door of J'riska's house interior (Border Watch) which was hiding its handle and tipped a pot on its side so the hanging wire isn't standing unsupported</li>

</ul>

<p class="h">v3.0.1 (2008-06-16)</p>
<b>UOP Changes/Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Removed all 3,333 (yes, that was the number) deletions of objects (ie underground rocks) to eliminate any chance that the UOP causes crash-on-exit as this has been confirmed to be a cause (if a mod loaded later changes an object an earlier loaded one deleted) and replaced them with object disables/moves where appropriate</li>
<li>Since it was all undeleted anyways, made the large inaccessible area of Fingerbowl Cave - Servant Crypt accessible; added trapdoors/ladders where necessary, bridged the chasm, changed the enemies from Slaughterfish (it's not underwater) to assorted undead, closed a large gap in a tunnel section and fixed pathgrids</li>
<li>Fixed Rythe Lythandas being unresponsive in the Brush With Death quest if Tivelas' request was initially refused</li>
<li>Fixed the Silver Shortsword missing its icon due to the engine not using the ArchiveInvalidation entry for the UOP-fixed texture properly</li>
<li>Removed the fix for the double-sided alpha hit from cobwebs; some 7xxx series nVidia cards didn't like them and blackscreened</li>
<li>Added NONE choice to the UOP AOE (Area of Effect) choice menu for if the player has a mod that nullifies the audio for this effect so that it isn't necessary to use one of the others</li>
<li>Improved the fix for the King of Miscarcand and Zombie Guardians following the player outside of Miscarcand so that it doesn't need GameMode scripting</li>
<li>Fixed introduced patches of bad UV mapping in the alcoves of IC top floor pieces ICTopFloor21.NIF and ICTopFloor25.NIF (face optimize artifacting) and the roof of FarmHouseInterior01.NIF (also restored a couple of accidentally deleted fireplace polygons)</li>
<li>Fixed optimization on ICGroundFloor19-21.NIFs and ICTopFloor01,05.NIFs causing ragged edges on the local map</li>
<li>Restored an accidentally deleted polygon in Skingrad house interior SkHouseMiddleInt03.NIF</li>
<li>Fixed accidental removal of Havok collision on Emetic Russula caps ( IngredEmeticRussulaCap01.NIF ) when their UV mapping was fixed (way back in March 2007)</li>
<li>Undid a shelf move in Ulen Athram's house (IC Talos Plaza) so that it doesn't interfere with OOO (causing floating objects)</li>
</ul>

<b>NPC and Quest Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>In the Path of Dawn quest, when the player has the third Commentaries volume and doesn't report back to Baurus, he will no longer try to find the player outside of the Imperial City, where he would be unable to fast-travel back with the player and could get stuck, breaking the Main Quest (he was intended to stay in the IC but the conditions were set up incorrectly)</li>
<li>Corrected oversight in the Dark Brotherhood Permanent Retirement quest where, after taking Adamus Phillida's finger, his corpse still had all of its fingers</li>
<li>If the player murders Ulrich Leland in the Cheydinhal dungeon after the Corruption and Conscience quest is completed, it will no longer result in a quest update indicating one of the characters needed to complete the quest has died</li>
<li>Fixed the dead "Bosmer Thief" (named this, and also referred to as a Bosmer several times) in the Brush With Death quest actually being an Altmer</li>
<li>Corrected conditions on one of Gogan's (Anvil) goodbyes for the Sirens' Deception quest which was appearing before the quest even started</li>
<li>Fixed two Legion soldiers who frequent inns (Weye and Gottshaw) missing their gauntlets (possibly intentional due to their drinking, but three others have them)</li>
<li>Fixed the Chorrol Countess' Bodyguard missing his helmet and shield</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Integrated the cell change in Quarn's nVidia Black Screen Fix into the UOP so the separate plugin is no longer required (the UOP had already had about 80% of the required interior CELL records in it due to edits to these cells anyway, so may as well integrate this so fixes to the cell names aren't overwritten; note that if mods change vanilla interior cells they may override the change. All that is required for modders to prevent this is that on an interior with Fog values Near, Far and Clip Dist. all zero, to set Near to 0.0001; Wrye Bash's "Fog Fix" function will set the appropriate values in any ESP automatically)</li>
<li>Improved the fix for the ghosts of the Blades following the player outside Sancre Tor and getting stuck so it doesn't need GameMode scripting, and they will be able to get back inside if they follow outside; also optimized the scripting for this area by removing a GameMode GetDistance check script from the door and moving what it did into the quest script</li>
<li>Improved the scripting for the Kvatch courtyard enemies so that it doesn't need a GameMode block; this may also fix the problem where after they are all dead Savlian Matius doesn't talk to the player and update the quest (but this may also be caused by using creature mods that change them)</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Istrius Brolus' (Bruma), Alberit Litte's, Casta Scribonia's, Reynald Jemane's, Valus Odiil's (Chorrol), Falanu Hlaalu's and Lazare Milvan's (Skingrad) keys not being tied to doors in their owned locations (which had no keys assigned)</li>
<li>Removed the useless Chorrol Jail Key from Chorrol day and night jailors (it opens nothing and their Chorrol Dungeon Key opens everything they need access to so this appears to be a duplicate)</li>
</ul>

<b>NIF Mesh and Texture Fixes - Statics and Clutter</b>
<ul>
<li>Closed the back of the large upperclass bookshelf ( UpperWallShelf03.NIF ) so that it isn't transparent in two locations (this mesh was already in the UOP)</li>
<li>Fixed the usual litany of seethrough gaps, bad UV mappings and unneccessary polygons in the interior of the Two Sisters Lodge in Skingrad ( SKHouseMiddleInt04B.NIF ) and the upstairs ( SkHouseMiddleInt04T.NIF ) and optimized from 1,286KB to 1,055KB and 455KB to 394KB respectively</li>
<li>Corrected the collision type in the window alcoves of Leyawiin Mages Guild sections LeyawiinMGInteriorShops.NIF and LeyawiinMGInteriorDinning.NIF {sic} so that they don't sound like water if walked on, fixed bad vertex color alignment in the ceiling and optimized from 1.18MB to 1.04MB in total</li>
<li>Closed several seethrough gaps in the exterior of Reynald Jemane's house in Chorrol ( ChorrolHouseMiddle05.NIF ) and optimized from 451KB to 372KB</li>
<li>Closed more gaps in BravilFightersGuildBasement01.NIF and also added BravilFightersGuildBasement02.NIF as there were ceiling gaps in that as well, and optimized from 354KB to 296KB</li>
<li>Fixed up CheydinhalHouseMiddle01, 04 and 05.NIFs some more; still had some gaps and bad UV mapping, and reduced 01's size another 4KB and 04 another 10KB</li>
<li>Fixed the hole in the middle of the manhole cover ( SewerManholeCover01.NIF ) being transparent, so if it was placed on a floor as it is in several IC houses as a load door the floor could be seen through it</li>
<li>Closed several seethrough gaps in castle pieces StackStairsRight03.NIF and StackStairsLeft03.NIF including under all the stonework of the banisters and optimized from 565KB to 391KB and 567KB to 384KB respectively</li>
<li>Fixed a missing windowframe beam on SKHouseLower04.NIF exposing the one-sided window cel (this mesh was already in the UOP)</li>
<li>Fixed a piece of bad UV mapping on boulder RockGreatForest1400FGDMoss.NIF and optimized from 152KB to 137KB</li>
<li>Fixed bad UV mapping on the sides of chargen dungeon pieces IDPitFloor2WayNoCol01C.NIF & IDPitFloor3WayRCol02C.NIF and optimized from 24KB to 19KB in total</li>
<li>Fixed bad UV mapping at the corners and several seethrough gaps on CastleKitchenFireplace01.NIF and optimized from 242KB to 185KB</li>
<li>Fixed the bedframe clipping through the blanket on ships' interior beds ( SIBed01.NIF ) and optimized from 75KB to 59KB</li>
<li>Closed a seethrough gap over the upper doorframe of ICGroundFloor18.NIF missed originally (mesh is already in the UOP)</li>
<li>Fixed several pieces of bad UV mapping on the broken barrel found in dungeons ( DunBarrel01Broken.NIF ) and optimized from 129KB to 96KB</li>
<li>Fixed skewed UV mapping in the grate of IC sewer piece SewerTunnelStraight04.NIF and optimized from 73KB to 63KB</li>
</ul>

<b>Test Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected scroll name "Summon Wraith" -> "Summon Faded Wraith" to match what it does (there is no Summon Wraith effect in the game; Faded and Gloom Wraith only)</li>
<li>Corrected scroll name "Summon Wraith Gloom" -> "Summon Gloom Wraith" to match the creature name (all Gloom Wraiths are named this way)</li>
<li>Corrected names of the Bruma and Anvil bodyguards to the Countess: "Countess's Bodyguard" -> "Countess' Bodyguard" (the other two were correctly this)</li>
<li>Corrected minor dialog typo 33DF3 MQ04 GREETING "Gods blood" -> "Gods' blood"</li>
<li>Corrected spelling of the Blankenmarch house of Floyd Nathans: "Floyd Nathan's House" -> "Floyd Nathans' House"</li>
<li>Corrected cell name "Damian Magius Quarters" -> "Damian Magius' Quarters"</li>
<li>Corrected key name "Ra'jhan's House Key" -> "Ra'Jhan's House Key"</li>
<li>Removed trailing space from Bravil shop cell name "The Fair Deal"</li>
</ul>

<b>Placement and Layout</b>
<ul>
<li>Closed several seethrough and onesided gaps in the Imperial Prison accessed during the Dark Brotherhood's Scheduled for Execution quest, and flipped two of the cell doors to open outwards so that they don't embed in the stone wall when opened</li>
<li>Unlocked a bedroom door in the Anvil Fighters' Guild Dining Hall (which was intended for the player) that could trap Azzan behind it</li>
<li>Lowered 17 instances of sewer piece sewerChannelEndcap01 slightly so they don't flicker where they intersect the floor</li>
<li>Disabled a useless doorframe in a tunnel of the IC sewer cell The North Tunnels that had no door it, so the top was transparent</li>
<li>Fixed about three dozen more slightly floating, clippy or misplaced objects in various interiors</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed audio and subtitle for a Leyawiin greeting for male and female Argonians and Khajiit that referred to the Count of Leyawiin as "Count Terentius" (who is the Count of Bravil)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v3.0.0 (2008-06-03)</p>
<b>UOP Changes</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated the UOP installer to Inno Setup v5.2.3 (the Oblivion.INI fixes in the self-installer now work properly)</li>
<li>Fixed the UOP self-installer not updating ArchiveInvalidation.txt with the fixed textures</li>
<li>Fixed saves crashing on load for a small number of people (~0.3%) if both the UOP and KoTN were present (removed deletions and moves of invisible light sources in the Anvil Chapel of Dibella)</li>
<li>Fixed player getting kicked out of the Fighters' Guild after the Hist quest (was caused by an engine bug with the SetFactionRank script command)</li>
<li>Fixed Bloated Float inn cell ownership after the quest there is completed (oops)</li>
<li>Updated the integrated Mentalor's Stat Restore accessible through the UOP menu to include the v1.1 checks/fixes for Magicka and Fatigue being affected by ModAV commands</li>
<li>The vampire feeding fix (see below in Game Mechanics) has been added to the UOP menu so it can be toggled on if required (off by default as it makes the vampirism scripting run much more often; turn it on if your vampiric character is having problems feeding)</li>
<li>Updated Open Cities compatibility with added Anvil buildings to work with new modular releases of Open Cities by Arthmoor</li>
<li>Removed ~4,000 Tamriel & CamoranParadise cell edits to Viper's Bugloss, Bergamot (both varieties) and Strawberry plants as fixed the meshes (see below); checked all 8,000+ instances of them and fixed a few hundred flying/embedded ones</li>
<li>Removed all LAND resource edits from the UOP ESP and replaced what the edits fixed (ie seethrough-underside walls/stairs, sharp land texture boundaries) by using statics to cover the errors; this reduced the size of the ESP by almost 900KB and also eliminates the occasional missing land glitches caused by an engine bug with many mods present where a cell's land temporarily fails to render</li>
<li>Removed about a hundred deletions to lights and other objects from the ESP that were referenced by other mods (OOO and RealLights) and disabled the objects instead which should prevent crashing-on-exit for some people</li>
</ul>

<b>NPC and Quest Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>In the Light The Dragonfires quest (climax of the Main Quest) the player will no longer get stuck in cutscene mode forcing a reload if the door to the Imperial Palace Council Chambers is closed when Martin meets with Ocato</li>
<li>The player will no longer be able to lose Martin if he is told to wait while escorting him in the Find the Heir, Weynon Priory and Light the Dragonfires quests; the quest target compass will point to Martin while he is waiting</li>
<li>Fixed the quest target compass in the Spies subquest of the Main Quest so that it isn't stuck on Captain Burd when the player knows of two spies to be eliminated and has gotten all possible info from Burd and Jauffre</li>
<li>If the player casts Bound Gauntlets while wearing the Bands of the Chosen in the Paradise subquest of the Main Quest, this will no longer make them unequippable (which will break the quest if the player hasn't entered the Forbidden Grotto) and leave the player with a permanent 50% weakness to fire</li>
<li>Fixed the Boethiah Tournament of Ten Bloods quest breaking if the player went to the left gate upon arriving (the enemy was too close to the gate, would see the player and attack, fall in the lava and die tying to get to the player, and then none of the gates after that would open)</li>
<li>In the Peryite Daedric Shrine quest, the souls of the followers that the player needs to capture will no longer run away if there are enemies around, which could result in them falling into the lava and dying where the player can't get to them</li>
<li>Fixed dialog in the Shadow Over Hackdirt quest that confused many players because the topic needed to complete the quest was grayed-out making it appear as though the quest could not be completed; moved Seed-Neeus asking about her daughter to her greeting if the quest is running, and she will immediately thank the player if Dar-Ma has already returned rather than asking if she is safe</li>
<li>Also in Shadow Over Hackdirt, fixed Dar-Ma traveling home to Chorrol after being rescued at snail's pace even though she's supposed to be fleeing for her life</li>
<li>Fixed major conflict bug between the Thieves Guild Ahdarji's Heirloom quest and the Sanguine Shrine quest where if they ran concurrently, Countess Alessia Caro would never retrieve her clothing including the quest item ring so the Thieves Guild questline was broken, and would also continue to eat for six hours a day (or never stop eating) after Sanguine was completed and this was no longer required</li>
<li>The player will no longer receive an erroneous Blood Price for killing Matthias and Sibylla Draconis in the Ahdarji's's Heirloom quest (they have nothing to do with the quest nor do they live where it takes place; instead they share a script with Caelia Draconis who is a legitimate Blood Price NPC for this quest; Sibylla is especially wrong as she's a feral cave-dweller who will attack the player without provocation)</li>
<li>Also fixed the shared Draconis script noted above making it a more efficient by removing the need for a GameMode block, and this should also fix the bug with the Dark Brotherhood quest Next of Kin where the game doesn't recognize when Matthias Draconis is dead</li>
<li>Fixed major bug in the Thieves Guild Boots of Springheel Jak quest where going to the Gray Fox first after getting the boots with a Blood Price would break the questline (he would remove the boots and send the player to Armand, but after getting reinstated by Armand the Gray Fox would just ask if the player had the boots again or say that he needed time to think, and the quest was unfinishable; Armand was supposed to complete the Boots quest)</li>
<li>Also fixed that if the player went to Armand first with a Blood Price, no Blood Price gold would be removed from the player and both Armand and the Gray Fox would pay the player the reward for the boots</li>
<li>Fixed conditions on the "Boots of Springheel Jak" topic so that it only appears for the Gray Fox as it is supposed to (it was appearing for all Thieves Guild Members; if selected only the subtitle would appear as there is no audio and dialog would terminate)</li>
<li>Fixed player getting a quest update that Methredhel beat them to the diary on returning to the Waterfront, and never getting the update that they stole it back, if the player pickpocketed it from her in the Thieves Guild initiation quest May The Best Thief Win</li>
<li>Corrected timer bug in May The Best Thief Win that caused Methredhel to never deliver the diary to Armand Christophe if the quest was done on the last few days of the current game month</li>
<li>Fixed Armand using the goodbye "Shadow hide you, Pickpocket" to the player in the May The Best Thief Win quest before the player is a member of the Thieves Guild (Pickpocket is the first rank)</li>
<li>Fixed Puny Ancus ending up sleeping in midair when Amusei's IC Waterfront bedroll is disabled at the end of May The Best Thief Win</li>
<li>In the Thieves' Guild Elven Maiden and Misdirection quests, if any of the Waterfront guards are dead, their corpses will no longer move to a point near Methredhel's shack when Hieronymus Lex arrives</li>
<li>Added alternate journal entries for the Thieves' Guild Misdirection quest if the player is the Arch-Mage of the Mages' Guild, as otherwise the quest made no sense at all (will not retroactively change the journal entries if the quest has already been completed as it can't be determined if the player was already the Arch-Mage at the time)</li>
<li>Fixed the Vampire Cure quest not stopping when it was completed, which could mess up Hal-Liurz's (Skingrad Castle) dialog and prevent her from bringing the Count again for Allies for Bruma</li>
<li>In the Caught in the Hunt quest, if either the Imperial or Nord hunter dies close to an invisible marker for the next hunter, it will no longer prevent the next hunter from appearing and break the quest; made all three hunters appear when the player goes into Hunter's Run as they are too far apart to worry about more than one fighting the player at once</li>
<li>Fixed the Caught in the Hunt quest breaking if the player fast-travelled or walked/swam to Fort Grief and didn't get close enough to the trigger marker to advance the quest, instead of using Kurdan's boat in Bravil</li>
<li>Also in the Caught in the Hunt quest, the player will be able to finish the quest if the Hunters Run keys are pickpocketed from the Imperial and/or Nord hunters and they are left alive</li>
<li>Fixed timer bug with the quest A Brotherhood Betrayed where Carius Runellius would not travel to Olav's Tap & Tack in Bruma to meet the player when he was supposed to if this event was triggered in the last few hours of the last day of the current game month</li>
<li>Fixed similar timer bug with the Corruption and Conscience quest where Garrus Darelliun would never go to the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn to complete the quest if this event was triggered in the last three hours of the last day of the current game month, leaving the quest unfinishable</li>
<li>Fixed that if the player waited in Castle Cheydinhal or whichever cell Garrus was in for him to go to the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn, he could disappear and never appear there, leaving the quest unfinishable</li>
<li>The Corruption and Conscience quest will now terminate properly if Ulrich Leland dies either at quest beginning (after getting the quest from a townsperson but not making any progress on it) or after talking to Llevana Nedaren (player would receive a quest update to see Garrus Darelliun but he had no dialog about the quest)</li>
<li>Fixed Ulrich Leland's dialog being severely wrong if the Cheydinhal part of the Allies For Bruma quest was completed after he had been sent to jail in Corruption and Conscience (he would respond as if he were at the Bruma battle with no audio or lip movement)</li>
<li>The player will no longer be able to start the Corruption and Conscience quest if Ulrich Leland is already in Bruma, which would cause him to leave (sometimes right in the middle of the battle) and similarly mess up his dialog as above</li>
<li>Ulrich Leland will no longer use the greeting "I don't know you, and I don't care to know you" on Cheydinhal guards (his subordinates)</li>
<li>Fixed some of the hello and goodbye dialog conditions for Llevana Nedaren and Garrus Darelliun in Corruption and Conscience so would be said to the wrong NPC's or at the wrong times</li>
<li>Fixed Cheydinhal residents still having the "Fines" initial dialog topic for the Corruption and Conscience quest even after the quest is completed</li>
<li>Mazoga the Orc should no longer die before the player starts her quests due to her Responsibility of zero causing her to steal food or attack guards (it was set this way so that she would seek Black Bows held by NPC's, and so will be set back to this when her quest is done and this supposed is to happen)</li>
<li>Fixed the first stage of the Join The Fighters Guild quest never appearing after finding out who to talk to in order to join, and also having no quest targets</li>
<li>Fixed Arvena Thelas being stuck outside and non-activatable (player can't talk to her) if she is sitting on the bench outside her house in Anvil reading when the player starts the Fighters Guild Rat Problem quest</li>
<li>Fixed the Mages Guild Anvil Recommendation quest and thus the entire questline from stalling without any notice if the player didn't tell Carahil that they were a merchant when asked</li>
<li>Also in the Anvil Recommendation quest, Carahil will no longer hang around in the player's room at the Brina Cross Inn after following there to ask the merchant question, preventing Arielle from talking to the player secretly and the quest from progressing</li>
<li>Fixed the Brina Cross Inn (location of the Anvil Recommendation quest) publican Christophe Marane as it was often possible to rent a room there once and have it persist for the rest of the game</li>
<li>In the Mages Guild Leyawiin Recommendation, wearing a Necromancer's Robe when confronted by Kalthar in Fort Blueblood will no longer break his confrontation dialog</li>
<li>Fixed Earana persisting after the Mages Guild Chorrol Recommendation though a rumor indicates that she left town after getting the book she wanted</li>
<li>Erthor should no longer continue to follow the player when the Mages Guild Skingrad Recommendation quest is completed</li>
<li>Hannibal Traven's scripted death in the Confront the King quest will no longer fail to work if the player talks to him right after conversation ends, if he is silenced, or for other reasons</li>
<li>Completing the Unexpected Voyage quest will no longer cause Hieronymus Lex's replacement (Servatius Quintilius) to appear prematurely (before the Thieves' Guild Taking Care of Lex quest is completed) and follow Lex everywhere</li>
<li>Fixed the Unexpected Voyage quest being unfinishable if the player chose to lock up Selene and left the other Blackwater Brigands alive, and Selene will now go to the IC Bastion prison rather than just disappearing at quest end</li>
<li>The player will no longer receive a Blood Price for killing Mercator Hosidus in self-defense in the Mages Guild Ulterior Motives quest if the Thieves Guild Lost Histories quest is running concurrently (there are other examples of Blood Price quest conflicts such as this, but with this one the player is attacked without warning by the Blood Price NPC)</li>
<li>Fixed Amusei's sleeping and wander locations at the beginning of the Thieves Guild Lost Histories quest being set to Leyawiin instead of Skingrad where the quest takes place</li>
<li>In the Dark Brotherhood quest A Kiss Before Dying, the player will no longer be stuck in cutscene mode if they are at a location that can only be reached by jumping (ie a roof) when Ungolim dies (as Lucien is approaching but can't reach the player)</li>
<li>Fixed stage 20 of the Dark Brotherhood Bad Medicine quest never appearing as the script for the medicine chest wasn't checking if the medicine had been removed but the poison not added yet (this didn't cause any problems completing the quest)</li>
<li>The priest Ilav Dralgoner will now go down to the Kvatch refugee camp when the quest Breaking the Siege of Kvatch is completed, rather than standing halfway up the hill to Kvatch for the rest of the game</li>
<li>Increased the quest update trigger distance to Weatherleah's marker in the Legacy Lost quest as the update could easily be missed if the player didn't get close enough to the house</li>
<li>Fixed a quest target for the Imperial Corruption quest so that it doesn't point to Servatius Quintilius if he's dead</li>
<li>Fixed bug that caused the Pale Lady to be enabled if the player visited the secret passage in the Skingrad Castle Wine Cellar before the Thieves Guild Lost Histories quest started (she would inevitably fight the player to the death and thus make her actions in the later quest impossible; this did not interfere with quest progression)</li>
<li>Fixed being able to buy the Honorblade of Chorrol back from Fathis Ules after returning it to him in the Sins of the Father quest, as then not being able to return it to Castle Chorrol didn't make sense (it can still be stolen from Castle Chorrol {see below in Items} but did not change that as it is reasonable that Fathis would still refuse to deal with the player or accept it out of spite as he had been crossed)</li>
<li>Corrected Fathis Ules' greetings after this quest if the Honorblade was returned to him so that he doesn't use the "rude" greeting if the player is a high-level thief who can use him as a fence</li>
<li>The player will no longer get quest updates from the Mephala Daedric Shrine quest after it is completed (such as if more residents of Bleaker's Way die)</li>
<li>Fixed the lich Erandur-Vangaril (Lost Boy Caverns) so that if the player encounters it at less than level 23 and it's non-interactive (which is by design) it doesn't remain this way permanently should the player return at a sufficient level</li>
<li>Fixed the dialog conditions in the Chorrol matchmaker mini-quest (does not appear in journal) between Bittneld the Curse-Bringer (guard captain) and Emfrid (Gray Mare publican) so that it works properly; most of the dialog was being skipped so that Emfrid would thank the player for telling Bittneld about her when this hadn't happened, and fixed Bittneld's daily visits to Emfrid after he says he will see her as they weren't working</li>
<li>Fixed the AI bug causing Imperial Legion Foresters to fight each other to the death if there was a deer in the area (a required side effect to keep them from fighting without going into a script bounce is that if two of them conflict over a deer, they will become uninterested in that deer thereafter)</li>
<li>Fighters Guild Porters should no longer follow the player around in the guildhall (unintended consequence of their repair service that caused them to act like shopkeepers)</li>
<li>The Shrine of Vaermina will now accept the otherwise useless Filled Colossal Black Soul Gem as an offering if the Mages' Guild Confront the King quest has been completed</li>
<li>Made the quest compass for the Daedric Shrine quests requiring offerings consistent so that they point to the respective shine when an offering is to be returned there</li>
<li>At the conclusion of the Brush With Death quest, the player will no longer be shouted at to leave the house by Rythe and Tivela Lythandas after rescuing Rythe if the quest happens to conclude when the house is locked for the night (which means the returning player was counted as trespassing)</li>
<li>The Painted Trolls in the Brush With Death quest should no longer be able to follow the player and Rythe through the painting at quest conclusion if any are left alive</li>
<li>Fixed that if the player murdered Gogan and/or Maelona at the end of the Sirens' Deception quest, no bounty could be incurred though they are members of the Anvil City Watch, and they would still be alive in Anvil</li>
<li>Naspia Cosma will now complete her daily attendance in Cheydinhal Castle County Hall and offer Blade training as she was supposed to; player would have to unlock and trespass in the Private Quarters to get her to train otherwise</li>
<li>Fixed Malintus Ancrus (Chorrol) sometimes not being outside his house when he's supposed to be in the Thieves' Guild Arrow of Extrication quest, and stuck outside permanently once the quest is completed</li>
<li>Giovanni Civello (Adamus Phillida's replacement after the Dark Brotherhood quest Permanent Retirement) will no longer be stuck in his office</li>
<li>Stopped Jirolin Doran's (Chorrol) useless GameMode script from running constantly (leftover from unfinished, unnamed quest MS17), also fixed his lack of basic AI schedule (only had the unused quest packages) so removed them and gave him the same ones as his wife Ariela Doran</li>
<li>Fixed Rienna ending up with two Desolate Mine keys in the related Fighters Guild quest</li>
<li>Wretched Aia and other Bravil NPC's should no longer fall in the canals from the bridge to Bravil Castle and drown</li>
<li>Edla Dark-Heart (Bruma) should no longer attack the player's horse for no apparent reason</li>
<li>Fixed Oghash gra-Magul's (Cheydinhal) AI so that she should no longer leave her Paint Horse parked in the IC Waterfront indefinitely</li>
<li>Rimalus Bruiant (Chorrol) should no longer occasionally attack his wife (Rena) and dogs due to missing faction membership</li>
<li>Viera Lerus (Bravil guard captain) will no longer endlessly wander between Bravil and Bruma after the Great Gate quest is completed</li>
<li>Fixed Dorian (IC Talos Plaza) still having an endless amount of gold if repeatedly pickpocketed though this was indicated to be resolved by the 1.1.511 and later patches (no need for him to have this as he is not a shopkeeper nor are shopkeeper's gold stores set up in this way)</li>
<li>Fixed Bazur gro-Gharz (Cheydinhal) having an endless amount of Steel Arrows</li>
<li>Fixed Damian Magus (IC Waterfront) having an endless amount of Steel Maces and keys</li>
<li>Fixed Bernadette Peneles and David Surilie (Skingrad) having an endless amount of bread loaves, hoes and rakes</li>
<li>Corrected oversight of Manduin's Coffin in Fort Blueblood respawning so the player could end up with multiple copies of Manduin's Amulet (unique item required for the Leyawiin Mages Guild Recommendation quest)</li>
<li>Fixed Hamlof Red-Tooth (Red Diamond Jewelry, IC Market District) missing his merchant container, causing him to wear clothing sold to him and bulking the savegame if many items were sold to him as his inventory never reset</li>
<li>Fixed Etira Moslin (Moslin's Dry Goods, Hackdirt) also having no merchant container (there was one but it was neglected to assign it to her properly)</li>
<li>Fixed Ormil (The Bloated Float, IC Waterfront) also having no merchant container; made the cupboard behind the bar his merchant container, locked it and assigned it to his key</li>
<li>Corrected Sinderion's (Skingrad) merchant container being a non-respawning one out of the six he has, so his inventory also never reset</li>
<li>Fixed Etira and Vlanhonder Moslin (Hackdirt) being able to hand out bounties like guards do though they are not guards (nor have affiliation with Imperial law, considering the Empire purposely burned down their town to keep it under control; standard bounty rules as for any village without guards will now apply as fixed the ownership of all interiors -- see below)</li>
<li>Corrected conditions on many Fighter's Guild rumors that are intended to be overheard by the player but not said directly to them, or only said to the player if they are in the Guild</li>
<li>Fixed the dialog conditions in the Wayward Knight quest so that Cheydinhal guards will no longer say that if the guards don't do something about the Oblivion gate they will leave town</li>
<li>In the Path of Dawn quest's meeting with Raven Camoran, if the player is seated Raven will no longer chastise the player for not being seated as instructed</li>
<li>In the Separated at Birth quest, asking Cheydinhal citizens about Reynald Jemane will no longer cause a quest update to see Guilbert if the player has already spoken to him bypassing this stage, and the Reynald Jemane topic will no longer persist when the quest is over</li>
<li>Fixed the dialog conditions in the Chorrol rumor that starts Separated at Birth so that it doesn't appear at the same time that the townsperson knows that the brothers are reunited</li>
<li>Fixed Falanu Hlaalu's dialog not updating the Seeking Your Roots quest when advising the player to seek Sinderion, as all the other alchemists do</li>
<li>Mage Scholars at the IC Arcane University will no longer rudely dismiss the player's conversation if the player is the Arch-Mage</li>
<li>Corrected conditions for Thamriel's dialog in the "Imperial City" topic so it appears for her instead of Elragail</li>
<li>Corrected being able to invest in Karinnarre's shop (she is present at Novaroma in Bruma) even though only Suurootan there buys or sells anything; Karinnarre was buy/sell enabled but had no services package (except for one that ran when the player was least likely to shop... during the Bruma battle) or merchant container so it appears that this was a leftover</li>
<li>Corrected conditions for one of Neville's dialogs in the Dark Brotherhood Whodunit quest which was checking if he was dead rather than Nels the Naughty</li>
<li>Corrected conditions on one of Vicente Valtieri's (Cheydinhal Sanctuary) goodbyes so that it appears for female players</li>
<li>The corpses of Toutius Sextius and Bernadette Peneles (Skingrad) will no longer persist indefinitely</li>
<li>Fixed conditions on the "Visit a prisoner" dialog topic for all Imperial jailors (except Skingrad) so that the player can't pick it again while already visiting a prisoner, which would cause the jailor to run off and unlock the already-unlocked door again</li>
<li>Fixed Anvil jailors sleeping in one of the jail cells instead of their own nearby beds</li>
<li>Bruma guards should no longer clump in one spot in the barracks and never finish their shift change</li>
<li>Corrected conditions on six Anvil guard AI eat packages (were checking if they were in the Chorrol rather than Anvil barracks)</li>
<li>Fixed Dion's (Skingrad guard captain) AI so that he no longer crouches for no apparent reason when doing his inspection patrols</li>
<li>Viranus Donton should no longer sleep in his armor</li>
<li>Bronsila Kvinchal will now eat dinner at the Bloated Float as she was supposed to</li>
<li>The named skeleton "Gran Struthe" in Fort Scinia will now carry the leveled piece of enchanted armor that it was intended to</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>(Note: this fix is in a separate ESP so that it is optional) Disabled ugly vampire aging which fixes the vampire bad-face bug where after being cured of vampirism, the player's face was replaced with the default male (even for female players) face for their race. (May only take effect on a new game. Player's face will still be pale and eyes will change during vampirism, but these should be undone properly and original face restored on cure. Don't activate this if you're using another fix such as EggDropSoap's or Scanti's OBSE fixes, or an alternate vampire system mod.)</li>
<li>Fixed some vampire players not being able to feed as the scripting wasn't checking for a feed event often enough when the player's vampirism had advanced; this fix is off by default and can be toggled with the UOP menu (see above in UOP changes)</li>
<li>Fixed the first-person perspective camera height when the player is seated (was at the height it would be if the player was standing)</li>
<li>Fixed all non-humanoid summons except for the Spider Daedra not being swim-enabled so if they were summoned over or fell into water (the player can't summon if swimming) they would stand motionless even if attacked, unable to move or attack (they don't have a separate set of swim animations so will use their standard walk animations for moving and fighting)</li>
<li>Changed the Magicka fountains found in Oblivion planes so that they work as described in the book Arcana Restored (with the book and a gold nugget in inventory, the player will have the option to recharge all their magical items from the fountain, consuming the nugget)</li>
<li>Fixed ownership for all interior Hackdirt cells as they were owned by the evil-flagged Hackdirt Brethren faction, which meant that no "red hand" showed on objects so they appeared unowned, yet the player would increase Items Stolen count and could get a theft bounty for taking them (Hackdirt Caverns now set to unowned, Jiv Hiriel's and Natch Pinder's Houses, Marlena Brussiner's House/Basement owned by their named owners, Moslin's Dry Goods/Basement owned by Etira Moslin, Moslin's Inn/Room/Guest Rooms and Chapel of the Brethren (public flag set to allow visiting) owned by Vlanhonder Moslin) and created a non-evil Hackdirt villagers faction for them</li>
<li>Fixed Eugal Belette's house (Chorrol) also appearing to be missing ownership (was actually owned by the Mythic Dawn faction, but no one but Eugal ever goes there so this appears to be yet another leftover component of an unfinished Chorrol quest) which would lead to increase of Items Stolen count picking up objects there</li>
<li>Similarly, taking Black Brugo's gold from the container in Telepe during the Knights of the White Stallion quest will no longer increase the player's Items Stolen count by 300 (which it would do even though the theft icon didn't show nor could a bounty ever be incurred)</li>
<li>Corrected the ownership of Llevana Nedaren's basement (Cheydinhal) so it is owned by her as the rest of the house is, not the Orum gang</li>
<li>Fixed S'rathad's house (IC Talos Plaza) and Ra'Jhan's house (IC Elven Gardens) both missing ownership for all three cells (all items were free for the taking, bed could be slept in, etc.)</li>
<li>Fixed the Leyawiin Mages Guild 2nd Floor East (Library) missing ownership (all items were free for the taking if player was not a guild member)</li>
<li>Fixed the IC Waterfront Lighthouse and its Private Quarters missing ownership (assigned to the Imperial Watch and Velan Andus respectively; public flag set so the player can still visit anytime, but items are owned)</li>
<li>Fixed the Private Quarters of the Feed Bag (IC Market District) being a public area (though owned and locked) so the player would not be considered trespassing and could sleep in the bed</li>
<li>Fixed the Private Quarters of the All Saints Inn (IC Temple District) also being a public area (although it is not locked) so the player could sleep in it, which defeated the purpose of paying for a bed</li>
<li>Fixed the ownership of all beds in guards' barracks in all towns except Leyawiin as the player could sleep in them</li>
<li>Fixed inconsistent ownership of several containers in the Merchant's Inn (IC Market District) room cells (many were player ownership though not in the player's rented room, and the desk in the player's room wasn't; food in the rented room remains player-owned and other items there are not)</li>
<li>Restored missing fix for the exploit of using Shadowmere as a four-legged Bag Of Holding by knocking her unconscious and storing items in her; may have been accidentally removed when the fix for getting arrested/expelled from Guilds for hitting owned horses was removed from the UOP after it was officially patched (if you happen to be exploiting this exploit your items will be transferred to the player when Shadowmere is activated)</li>
<li>The load door icons in three Underpall Cave cells will no longer be duplicated due to both the left and right components of the doors having icons</li>
<li>Fixed the water height in one of cells in the IC Talos Plaza being too high causing a vertical break in the water at one end (also lowered all water flora to match)</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the War Axe of Beguilement (glass, casts Soul Trap) and Warhammer of Sapping (silver, casts Drain Magicka) never appearing in-game as it was neglected to add them to leveling lists</li>
<li>The Turn Undead and Weakness to Poison enchantments of all versions of the Shadowhunt bow (Dark Brotherhood quest reward) will now work properly (had no duration; also adjusted the enchantment cost manually for a good progression compensating for the extra charge required without overpowering them)</li>
<li>The Demoralize effect of the completed Blade of Woe (all levels), the Drain Fatigue effect of Sinweaver, the Drain Willpower effect of the Staff of Nenalata and the Drain Strength effect of Sufferthorn (all levels for all these items) will now work properly (all had a zero duration)</li>
<li>Changed the Human Blood "potions" found in Vicente Valtieri's quarters and the Pale Lady's lair so that if the player is a vampire, drinking one counts as feeding (Vicente and the Pale Lady can feed from them, so the player should also be able to)</li>
<li>The latent Blade of Woe will no longer remain a quest item stuck in the player's inventory if the player is permanently expelled from the Dark Brotherhood</li>
<li>The Honorblade of Chorrol will no longer remain a quest item after the Sins of the Father quest is completed (could be stolen from the Countess afterwards)</li>
<li>Varulae's Crystal Ball will no longer remain a quest item that could stick in the player's inventory after the Ghost Ship of Anvil quest is done (although it is given to her, it could be retrieved by the player)</li>
<li>The Journal of the Lord Lovidicus will no longer remain a quest object stuck in the player's inventory if the quest is terminated by Agronak gro-Malog dying before completion</li>
<li>The Carved Panel will no longer remain a quest object that will stick in the player's inventory if picked up if Umbacano dies in the Secrets of the Ayleids quest before using it (unlike the others, this one will be removed from player inventory if stuck; it can't be made droppable as if it was it would fall out of the wall it's in before being found)</li>
<li>Made the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary Well Key a non-quest item; no reason for it ever to have been one as it's not like the front door ever is inaccessible nor is the well entrance required for any quests</li>
<li>Corrected the ownership of the "Love Letter from Relfina" in Roland Jenseric's house in the Order of the Virtuous Blood quest and the Suspicious Note evidence recovered by the player in Corruption and Conscience so that they no longer count as stolen items</li>
<li>The silver War Axes of Depletion and Sapping will no longer be missing their Absorb and Drain Magicka enchantments respectively</li>
<li>Fixed the Claymore of Curses (also changed the name to this... see below) having only half the enchantment capacity it should have</li>
<li>Fixed scrolls of "Absorb Skill: Hand to Hand" absorbing Destruction instead</li>
<li>Fixed the magnitude of the effect of the Potion of Chameleon being the same as the Weak Potion of Chameleon</li>
<li>Fixed the magnitude of the effect of the Poison of Burden being the same as the Weak Poison of Burden (also increased the magnitude of the Strong version so that the progression is proper and matches other poisons)</li>
<li>Arena Raiments (Heavy & Light and both Raiments of Valor) will no longer hide the wearer's amulets, as they are open to the sternum (larger amulets may clip slightly, but no more so than on other armor that doesn't hide them)</li>
<li>Corrected oversight whereby there were five skill books for every skill except Speechcraft; made the book "Children of the Sky" the fifth Speechcraft skill book as it's sufficiently rare yet not unique, was not already a skill book, and the content is so tailor-made for it that it's arguable that it was the intended fifth Speechcraft book all along</li>
<li>Added missing low texture size icons for paintbrush jars ( IconPaintBrushJar.dds ) so that the wrong one is not being used if Oblivion is not set to Large texture size</li>
<li>Made the Parchment items (only four instances, two each in Forts Cuptor and Istirus) so that they can be picked up (not worth anything anyways)</li>
<li>Fixed Hamlof Red-Tooth's (Red Diamond Jewelry, IC Market District) key not being tied to two doors and six display cases in his shop</li>
<li>Fixed one of Fjotreid's (Bruma, Hammer and Axe) merchant containers being unlocked and not tied to his key</li>
<li>Fixed two bedroom doors, one intended for the player, in the Anvil Mages' Guild not being tied to the Mages' Guild Key, which could trap one of the trainer NPC's (Marc Gulitte or Felen Ralas) inside</li>
<li>Fixed the Bravil Castle Dungeon door to the cell area being tied to the Bruma Castle Dungeon key</li>
<li>Fixed an unpickable Old Wooden Door in the Bravil Wizard's Grotto (accessed during the Arrow of Extrication quest) not being tied to any keys (tied it to Aren's Strange Key; this door is accessible from both sides so there is no reason it was permanently locked)</li>
<li>Fixed several interior doors including the bedroom in Hammer & Tongs and Toutius Sextius' house (Skingrad) not being tied to the owner's keys</li>
<li>Fixed the interior door in Nord Winds (Bruma) not being tied to the owners' keys (or any others)</li>
<li>Fixed Usheeja's house's upstairs door (IC Talos Plaza) not being tied to her key</li>
<li>Fixed the side door of Roland Jenseric's cabin not being tied to his key as the other door is (also locked it with the same degree as the other lock, as otherwise it was of no use to have the other unlocked and locked by the quest if the side door is always open)</li>
<li>Fixed the Legion Commander's Chest in the Imperial Legion Offices being tied to the office key instead of Adamus Phillida's Commander's Chest Key (which was unused)</li>
<li>Added the missing Bruma Dungeon key to both jailors and Tyrellius Logellus</li>
<li>Added the missing Imperial City Lighthouse Key to Velan Andus</li>
<li>Added the missing J'mhad's House Key to J'mhad (also tied it to two doors in his house that were locked but had no key assigned)</li>
<li>Added the missing Leyawiin Chapel Key to Primate Kantav Cheynoslin</li>
<li>Added the missing Skingrad Chapel Key to Primate Valandrus Abor</li>
<li>Added the missing Ra'Jhan's House Key to Ra'Jhan (IC Elven Gardens) and removed the erroneous Ra'Jahirr's Key he had</li>
<li>Added the missing NW Watch Tower Key to Itius Hayn (Watch Captain) and removed the erroneous NE Watch Tower Key he had</li>
<li>Added the missing Valtieri's Key to Vicente Valtieri (Cheydinhal DB Sanctuary)</li>
<li>Fixed the following keys used in-game not being tied to/unlocking anything:

<b>NIF Mesh and Texture Fixes - Clothing, Armor and Weapons</b>
<ul>
<li>Removed the useless alpha channel from the texture for the skirt of the female Red Velvet Outfit (Textures\Clothes\Upperclass\Pants05F.dds) which caused it to disappear in fog or when a refraction shader was applied to the player in some cases; this also reduced its size from 1.33MB to 682KB</li>
<li>Fixed the Mage's Robe ( RobeMage{F}.NIFs ), Arch-Mage's Robe ( RobeMageArch{F}.NIFs ), Black Hand Robe ( RobeMCBlack{F}.NIFs ) and Necromancer's Robe ( RobeNecromancerF/M.NIFs ) using duplicates of the same 1.33MB normal map instead of sharing a common normal map, which would waste about 4MB of video memory if they were loaded simultaneously, plus corresponding increase in load times</li>
<li>Also, as above, fixed the lowerclass Tan Robe ( RobeLC01F/M.NIFs) and Green Robe ( RobeLC02F/M.NIFs ) not sharing their 1.33MB normal map (note that there are other examples of this but these two sets of robes were the worst offenders; not fixing all of them as the fixed NIF's need to be not installed, or removed/overwritten, if using retexture mods), and fixed the normal map ( now UOPRobeLC_n.dds ) so that the specular highlighting on the belt buckle isn't extending onto the sleeves</li>
<li>The Staff of Worms ( MG19KingOfWormsStaff.NIF ) should no longer fall through the floor when dropped, improved the smeared UV mapping on the top of the skull and optimized from 527KB to 288KB</li>
<li>Corrected the held position of the Elven Longsword ( Weapons\Elven\Longsword.NIF ) so that its cross guard (including the strangely unprotective decorative spikes that would make it a rather painful thrusting sword for the wielder) isn't clipping into the player's hand</li>
<li>Fixed the misaligned Havok on the head of the Daedric Warhammer ( Weapons\Daedric\Warhammer.NIF ) and optimized from 88KB to 63KB</li>

<b>Placement and Layout (also see audits at the bottom)</b>
<ul>
<li>Moved the stool by the steps in the basement of Rosethorn Hall (player's Skingrad house) as the player could not stand after sitting in it and would have to reload</li>
<li>Moved a barrel in the IC Elven Garden Sewer Waterworks as (very rarely) Baurus could fall from the stairs it was near and get stuck behind it in the Path of Dawn quest of the Main Quest</li>
<li>Removed a section of Fingerbowl Cave - Servant Crypt (200+ objects) that was outside the playable area; it was unfinished as could not be traversed due to an impassable cliff and hole in the ceiling, and held nothing of interest</li>
<li>Fixed bad pathgrids/nodes in a section of the Cheydinhal Oblivion plane (Wayward Knight quest) that had numerous nodes underground and hidden in rocks</li>
<li>Fixed a tunnel section overlapping with the cave it attaches to in Unmarked Cave Mazeway; added two tunnel pieces to shift the parallel tunnel section away and adjusted objects and pathgrids appropriately</li>
<li>Fixed Drarana Thelis' house (Harlun's Watch) interior (FarmHouseInterior03) not matching its exterior (was Farmhouse02); replaced the exterior and moved objects appropriately (moved the house over the load door not vice versa as its position is stored in the save)</li>
<li>Corrected 101 load doors in the Imperial City being double French-type doors on the exterior, but single doors on the interior (changed the interior rather than the exterior ones as the double-doors are the correct ones for exterior access and since load doors are stored in the save it's more likely to take effect on an existing game this way)</li>
<li>White Gold Tower should no longer disappear when in the Talos Plaza district</li>
<li>Deleted a dozen pathgrid nodes in Crayfish Cave that were completely outside the playable area and moved up three connected to them that were underground</li>
<li>Added pathgrid nodes to a tunnel section of Sandstone Cavern that was completely missing them (enemies and followers would not go into it)</li>
<li>Fixed the pathgrid nodes in the IC Arcane University Chironasium stairs so that Delmar and possibly others should no longer get stuck</li>
<li>Closed gaps of seethrough nothingness at the bases of three columns in Vilverin</li>
<li>Closed two large gaps in the floor and stairs in Nenalata Sel Aran Arpena</li>
<li>Closed a very large gap (almost large enough to walk through) between an Ayleid light fixture and its alcove and closed gaps between two Ayleid room dividers and the floor/wall in Narfinsel</li>
<li>Closed a large seethrough gap in the side of the exterior Castle Skingrad and fixed the roof trim so that it no longer clips through the roof pieces</li>
<li>Fixed pathing on the Skingrad castle courtyard walkway so that NPC's don't walk into the walls on it</li>
<li>Closed a seethrough gap at the side and base of one of the interior Skingrad town walls</li>
<li>Improved the fix for the cathedral lights by replacing the three in the Anvil Chapel of Dibella in such a way that they will not interfere with KoTN (where three of them fall down; those three still won't swing with KoTN present but will without it)</li>
<li>Closed a seam in the Castle Anvil courtyard walls, fixed a small flicker of overlap (out of player reach usually) and moved a hanging banner so that the wall isn't clipping through it</li>
<li>Closed a seam in the Anvil exterior town walls near the dock gate and two in the exterior walls far from the entrances</li>
<li>Moved the tree clipping into Benirus Manor (player's home) and closed a seethrough gap in a wall in Anvil</li>
<li>Moved the recipes on the counter in Anvil Mages' Guild so they don't fall into the counter when moved, and moved a basket embedded in a barrel in the Library</li>
<li>Aligned the door into the Imperial Palace used in the Thieves Guild Ultimate Heist quest so there isn't a gap of nothingness showing</li>
<li>Closed several seethrough seams and gaps in the Old Way dungeons of the Thieves Guild Ultimate Heist quest</li>
<li>Closed dozens of other gaps in the ceilings of Imperial City sewer cells wherever the SewerTunnel11 mesh was used</li>
<li>Moved a torn sack of grain half-embedded in a barrel, grounded several chairs and attached a lamp to its column in the Anvil Barracks</li>
<li>Grounded a chest and flipped another facing the wrong way in the Fo'c's'le Private Rooms (Anvil)</li>
<li>Moved two tapestries and a chair slightly embedded in the wall in Heinrich Oaken-Hull's house (Anvil)</li>
<li>Closed a small seethrough gap in the bar and scaled down a painting clipping into the wall at its sides in the Count's Arms (Anvil)</li>
<li>Moved a bowl embedded under a shelf in the Anvil Lighthouse Basement</li>
<li>Moved a handbill out of the fire in Gogan's house in Anvil (while not out-of-place to put one there, it would never burn)</li>
<li>Closed a see-through gap of nothingness at the base of the load door in Horse Whisperer Stables (Anvil)</li>
<li>Moved three hanging lamps in the Cloud Ruler Temple Armory so they won't be "twitchy" with the off-center ceiling Havok collision (these lamps were Havoked by the UOP)</li>
<li>Moved a ceiling beam in Barren Mine flickering badly due to overlapping with another beam and grounded a Goblin Totem staff standing on nothing</li>
<li>Fixed a garlic clove in Derelict Mine that had an amount (causing a popup dialog when activated) and moved a Septims coin embedded in a stool leg and a crystal ball embedded in the table in Derelict Mine Lair</li>
<li>Fixed two Fly Amanitas in the IC Temple District (5,14) being unharvestable</li>
<li>Fixed a non-activating cupboard in Shagol gro-Bumph's house (Aleswell)</li>
<li>Lowered Hanz gro-Hubrag's house (Blankenmarch) slightly so that he can get back into it as the porch was too high for him to walk onto it</li>
<li>Moved a potstand down so that the seethrough ends are hidden (and it's not leaning on nothing), grounded its pot and a chair, moved a table embedded in a tapestry, and moved several objects that were supposed to be leaning on walls but were some distance from them in Floyd Nathan's house (Blankenmarch)</li>
<li>Moved a tipped shelf leaning on nothing in Hans gro-Hubrag's house (Blankenmarch)</li>
<li>Grounded two chests and a bowl, attached a sconce well off of its support, moved a head of lettuce embedded in a bowl, raised a broom slightly embedded in the floor and moved a painting slightly embedded in a beam (which conveniently covered the ends of a rack sticking through from the other side) in Philip Franc's house (Blankenmarch)</li>
<li>Moved a chest that was ungrounded, embedded in a wall and facing the wrong way (all at once), moved a bed slightly embedded in the wall and grounded several chairs in the Ulfgar Family House (Bleaker's Way)</li>
<li>Fixed a non-activating and slightly ungrounded chest of drawers, grounded a chest on another chest of drawers and some chairs in J'riska's house (Borderwatch)</li>
<li>Closed several thin gaps in the Chorrol town walls and lowered a seethrough-underside small garden wall</li>
<li>Fixed an entrance stairway to the Castle Chorrol Barracks being too far from its tower, which exposed seethrough gaps behind it and hid the real door behind the fake placeholder door, and two others that also were exposing seethrough gaps at the back</li>
<li>Fixed the exterior front door to Eugal Belette's house in Chorrol having two overlapping handles because the door was placed too far back, so the fake placeholder door showed through (will only take effect on a new game)</li>
<li>Grounded a flying barrel in Chorrol</li>
<li>Corrected Otius Loran (Chorrol chapel) starting about at about chest height off the floor</li>
<li>Grounded three flying crates and two weapon racks, moved a chest slightly embedded in the floor, attached four sconces to the wall and aligned the load door to close a gap of nothingness in the Chorrol Fighters' Guild Tower</li>
<li>Moved a book stuck in the downstairs ceiling up through the floor (to where the other books are) and moved a goblet that couldn't be picked up as it was inside the building Havok in Reynald Jemane's house (Chorrol)</li>
<li>Moved the fire grate and logs that were offcenter embedded in the fireplace wall, grounded a noticeably flying coffee table, and attached a sconce to its post in Northern Goods and Trade (Chorrol)</li>
<li>Moved the load door to the upstairs in Vilena Donton's house's main floor (Chorrol) to close large seethrough gaps at the sides</li>
<li>Moved a footlocker chest outside the playable area to a guard's bed that was missing it and a barrel and sack hidden in an inaccessible area under the stairs, moved a crate slightly embedded in a wall, flipped a chest facing the wrong way, and grounded a barrel in the Chorrol guard barracks</li>
<li>Closed a seethrough gap in a hallway floor caused by a misaligned room piece, grounded a slightly flying chest, four chairs and a rug and moved a crate slightly embedded in a column in the Chorrol Castle Gate Tower</li>
<li>Removed a door and doorframe (didn't lead anywhere) from the exterior Tamriel Chorrol town walls, as it was not present in the inside ChorrolWorld walls nor is there a wall door in the tower cell</li>
<li>Grounded a noticeably flying rug, moved a barrel partially embedded in the wall and a bookshelf with a column partially embedded in/sticking through it in Kvatch Chapel Hall</li>
<li>Moved the throne pedestal in Kvatch Castle Great Hall so that the seethrough back isn't exposed</li>
<li>Closed several gaps in the Leyawiin exterior town walls</li>
<li>Attached a lamp to Leyawiin Chapel's exterior that was off the wall, moved another that was embedded a little too deeply, and deleted a duplicated-in-place rock</li>
<li>Moved two statues so that their seethrough-underside bases aren't exposed, moved three firelog piles so that they aren't clipping through the sides of the braziers, closed a seethrough gap in the balcony, and moved two corner pieces so that they aren't clipping through columns in Leyawiin Castle County Hall</li>

<li>Grounded several chairs and tables, attached two paintings to walls, and moved a pair of shoes embedded in a chest of drawers in the Leyawiin Coast Guard Station</li>
<li>Fixed a non-activating dresser, attached two paintings to the wall and grounded a bench, chair, rug, two chests of drawers and a chest in Betto Plotius' house (Leyawiin)</li>

<li>Fixed the collision in both Arena cells so that the player can't walk through the large double-doors (they don't open)</li>
<li>Grounded several food items floating more than the Havok requires and a chair, and moved a tapestry slightly clipping the wall in the Merchants' Inn (IC Market District), and moved a bed out of a tapestry and bench slightly in a wall in the upstairs area</li>
<li>Moved the unopenable merchant chest to outside the playable area (as is the case with all other merchant containers like this), rotated/scaled two tapestries clipping into the wall and grounded two noticeably flying benches in The Main Ingredient (IC Market District), and in the basement grounded two sacks, a chair and a barrel and moved a crate out of the wall and raised another slightly in the floor</li>

<b>Text Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Changed the confusing name of the Mages Guild Chorrol Recommendation quests "Fingers of the Mountain" -> "Chorrol Recommendation" to match the other quests (Chorrol seems to have been developed first outside the IC judging by the number of remnants of undeveloped quests and locations there)</li>
<li>Corrected name of plant "St. Jahn's Wort" -> "St. John's Wort" and corresponding ingredient "St. Jahn's Wort Nectar" -> "St. John's Wort Nectar" (its internal name is "John" not "Jahn", and there is no St. Jahn either in TES lore or in reality)</li>
<li>Corrected both varieties of Cinnabar Polypore (red and yellow) having the same name though they are separate flora objects, ingredients and have different effects; changed to "Red Cinnabar Polypore" and "Yellow Cinnabar Polypore"</li>
<li>Changed goblin names: "Bloody Hand Chef" -> "Bloody Hand Goblin Chef", "Bloody Hand Rat Farmer" -> "Bloody Hand Goblin Rat Farmer", "Sharp Tooth Chef" -> "Sharp Tooth Goblin Chef" to match all others</li>
<li>Changed the name of the useless item found on the ground in random Oblivion plane #6: "Blood Potion" -> "Discarded Daedric Blood Vial" (it's a misc. item not a potion so can't be equipped ie for vampire feeding, and has no known purpose but has a unique container which makes a nice player house decoration so didn't want to remove it from the game)</li>
<li>Corrected goblin name: "Three Feathers Goblin Shaman" -> "Three Feather Goblin Shaman" (matches all others in this tribe)</li>
<li>Changed name of Cheydinhal Mages Guild Recommendation items: "Black Soul Gem" -> "Falcar's Black Soul Gem" to distinguish them from others</li>
<li>Corrected name of Huntsman Moccasins: "Moccasin" -> "Moccasins" as they only appear in pairs (all the shoe pairs are pluralized)</li>
<li>Corrected name: "Silver Glass" -> "Silver Cup" (as it's a stemless tumbler made of silver rather than glass; matches the Pewter Cup)</li>
<li>Corrected name of scroll: "Summon Skeleton Archer" -> "Summon Skeleton Guardian" as this matches the enchantment and thus what it does, and there is no skeleton archer summon effect in the game</li>
<li>Corrected names of clutter scrolls ClutterPotionRecipe04 and ClutterPotionRecipe05: "Shopping List" -> "Recipe"</li>
<li>Corrected name of the warhammer of burden: "Akaviri Warhammer Burden" -> "Warhammer of Burden" (missing "of", it's clearly a Dwarven hammer with same icon, mesh and stats as others, and none of the other enchanted Dwarven weapons have their origin in their names)</li>
<li>Corrected name of one of the enchanted silver longswords: "Claymore of Jinxing" -> "Claymore of Curses" as it uses the stronger enchantment (also corrected its capacity... see above)</li>
<li>Corrected names of the Elven longswords (including the Arena and Replica variations): "Long Sword" -> "Longsword" which matches all others in the game</li>
<li>Corrected name "Brush Jar" -> "Paint Brush Jar" to match the object in them</li>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed missing open/close sounds for cathedral crypt doors ( CathedralCryptDoor01 ) used in 31 places</li>

<li>Fixed the opening and closing sounds for two types of wooden coffins found in Necromancer lairs which were using the stone coffin sounds</li>
<li>Corrected the LIP (lipsynch animation) for 148 lines of dialog from all races/genders that didn't synch properly because there were polysyllabic numbers (as digits, not spelled out in words) in the dialog text that they were generated from</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for 48 lines of NPC conversation dialog for all races that referred to Mach-Na (Cheydinhal) as male</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for 46 lines of NPC conversation dialog for all races that referred to Deetsan (Cheydinhal) as male</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for 31 lines of NPC conversation dialog for all races that referred to Nahsi (Bravil) as male</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for 26 lines of NPC conversation dialog for all races that referred to Vigdis (Anvil) as male</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for a further 22 lines of NPC conversation dialog for all races that referred to Falanu Hlaalu (Skingrad) as male</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for 11 lines of NPC conversation dialog for all races that referred to Estelle Renoit (Chorrol) as male</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for a further 11 lines of NPC conversation dialog for all races that referred to Salmo the Baker (Skingrad) as female</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for 2 lines of Lorgren Benirus' monologue that referred to Carahil as male</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for a line of Julienne Fanis' dialog that referred to S'drassa as female</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for Hil the Tall's greeting that referred to Arkay as female</li>
<li>Corrected audio for a Nord male Bruma line of conversation that referred to Right-Wind as female (all other races' lines and the subtitle were already correct)</li>
<li>Fixed audio and subtitle for 9 lines of dialog for Chorrol residents if Dar-Ma died in the Shadow over Hackdirt quest that said incorrectly said that it was "Dar-Ma's daughter" (instead of either just Dar-Ma, or Seed-Neeus' daughter)</li>
<li>Removed an unneeded "Kill him" (referring to the player; there was no equivalent line for a female player) from Claude Maric's confronting dialog during the Nothing You Can Possess quest</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for two lines of Guilbert Jemane's dialog that indicated that Weatherleah is north of Fort Carmala (it's south, though more accurately southwest)</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for a Cheydinhal Breton/Imperial line of conversation that said that Dervera Romalen is happy about the Newlands Lodge because "the Red Queen drinks there" (the quest with this non-existent NPC was never developed and its only other remnant is an empty chest and cell name in Unmarked Cave)</li>
<li>Fixed an outtake line of greeting dialog for Quill-Weave after the Fighters' Guild Rats quest if the player "ratted" on her</li>
<li>Fixed a line of dialog for Nord and Orc males (specifically Kurz gro-Baroth) on the "Fighters Guild" topic not matching the subtitle at all (differed from all other instances so may have been recorded when only Chorrol was the guild at which the player could join)</li>
<li>Fixed the amount in Shum gro-Yarug's response if the player declines Rosethorn Hall as too expensive not matching the actual price</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for a Bruma topic Nord male line of dialog that said Lyra Rosentia was a collector of Akaviri artifacts and may have a project (she isn't and has nothing to do with the Lifting the Vale quest; may have been rewritten)</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for a line of Ursanne Loche's dialog for the Caught in the Hunt quest indicating to rescue Aleron "from that island" which could appear before it was possible to know he was there</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for a Nord/Orc Chorrol conversation that indicated Bongond sells horses at the Grey Mare (he only sells at North Country Stables, which he never leaves)</li>
<li>Fixed inconsistent audio for Elven and Redguard males and females for a wilderness conversation line about the Imperial City that said "a waterside dock area" where all other races/genders said "waterside dock areas" which matches the subtitle</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for post-Imperial Corruption greeting of Luronk that indicated he had testified against watch captain Itius Hayn (instead of Audens Avidius)</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for a line of Eilonwy's dialog in the "Mages Guild" topic indicating that Orintur casts Reflect spells and teaches them (he only sells spells, and only Alteration rather than Mysticism)</li>
<li>Corrected Aelwin Merowald's line presenting the ring at the conclusion of the Go Fish quest where he indicated that "they" would be valuable whereas there's only one object given (subtitle was already correct)</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle for one of Hieronymus Lex's lines to Myvryna Arano in the Thieves Guild Elven Maiden quest so that they match (could not just change the subtitle as was at the 150 character limit)</li>

<p class="h">v2.2.0 (2007-08-07)</p>
<ul>
<li>The UOP now has a menu. To access it, open the console with ` or ~ or whatever key is used in your locale, type <b>startquest uop</b> (not case sensitive) and press Enter, then close the console (may take five seconds to appear the first time, but instantaneous after this. You'll only get a warning dialog box if you try to open it during combat.) It will allow you to see that the UOP is active and the version number, run the Stat Restore, change the "silent/invisible" AOE spell effect to one that really is if another mod has altered it (if you were using the UOP AOE Compatibility Patch you can probably remove it,) toggle off and on the Poisoned Apple warning dialog, or remove stuck Bound items</li>
<li>Integrated Mentalor's Stat Restore mod into the UOP; it can be accessed via the menu above and will fix attributes, skills, magicka, fatigue and encumbrance if they have been damaged by mods and chapels/spells/potions or dropping all items isn't fixing them</li>
<li>Made the Poisoned Apple warning optional; it can be disabled and enabled via the menu (see above)</li>
<li>For now, removed the fix for archers not equipping bows during sleep packages to eliminate any possibility that the UOP causes crashes or other problems (nothing confirmed so far, but with so many CTD and other problems with other mods it is best to err on the side of stability for the time being)</li>
<li>Cleaned some noise out of the dialog audio for the custom race game start fix</li>
<li>Updated the UOP installer to Inno Setup v5.1.13</li>
<li>Fixed freezing for several seconds or occasionally crashing to desktop when the player levels up (due to bad .INI setting introduced with the v1.2x patch; the self-installing UOP will correct this setting at install time)</li>
<li>Going into and out of a random Oblivion cave system at one end and then into the other end will no longer result in the player getting stuck with "This door leads nowhere." (the message will still appear as it's hardcoded but the door will work)</li>
<li>Fixed the Acrobatics skill's fall damage reduction perk as it was only one-fiftieth (or less) as much as it should have been so was practically worthless</li>
<li>Improved the fix for guards not carrying bows all the time to force them to equip their sword and shield again once out of combat (they may still carry bows sometimes, but leaving the area and returning in three days should cause them to carry swords once more)</li>
<li>Taking items from the crates outside, or from the interior of the Maria Elena (Imperial City Waterfront), will no longer increase the player's Items Stolen count (which it would do even though the theft icon didn't show nor guards notice)</li>
<li>Corrected the nearby Bloated Float ownership as well as the player could steal any number of items in plain view without repercussions (the ownership will properly change for the related quest)</li>
<li>Similarly, picking up items from Lake Arrius Caverns during the Dagon Shrine quest (including the Mysterium Xarxes itself) will no longer increase the player's Items Stolen count</li>
<li>UI mods that show the player's next faction rank will no longer show "DUMMY" when the player has reached the highest rank of the faction</li>
<li>The disease Astral Vapors (contracted from Dread Zombies) will no longer bypass disease resistance</li>
<li>Corrected the disease "BrainRot" which was draining Strength instead of Intelligence, and added the missing space to its name (there is a similarly named but unrelated disease "Brown Rot" which was also present in Morrowind that drains Strength)</li>
<li>Fixed the following spells being listed as an incorrect level skill level (Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert or Master) by spell-renaming mods and Wrye Bash because their internal skill level differed from the actual: Absorb Attribute: Endurance/Intelligence/Luck/Speed/Strength/Willpower, Absorb Fatigue (the 25 pts. for 20 seconds on touch version), Absorb Skill: Alteration/Athletics/Block/Conjuration/Heavy Armor/Illusion/Marksman/Security, Bound Bow, Bound Mace, Bound War Axe, Burdening Touch, Corrode Armor, Corrode Weapon (note that both Corrodes have two versions; the ones corrected are the 20 pts. on Target versions), Cure Disease, Cure Poison, Curse of Weakness, Drain Attribute: Intelligence, Drain Skill: Light Armor, Fearful Gaze, Greater Fortify Fatigue, Ice Storm, Legendary Soul Trap, Lightning Storm, Paralyze (the 10 seconds on touch version), Rage, Revitalize, Shadow (the 15% for 15 seconds version), Silence (the 15 seconds on target version), Touch Of Fear and Voice Of Dread</li>
<li>Corrected the magnitude of The Unwelcome Guest spell sold by the Dark Brotherhood; though listed as "Open Easy Lock" it could not open many locks of this level</li>
<li>All Chorrol, three Leyawiin and three Skingrad day guards will no longer be missing their shields</li>
<li>In the Order of the Virtuous Blood quest, killing Roland Jenseric when the quest is completed will no longer result in a quest advancement indicating the player should see Seridur (who's already dead)</li>
<li>Fixed several errors with the rampart Dremora in the Battle for Castle Kvatch: they will no longer be prone to dying by jumping from the ramparts, if they should fall, their corpses will no longer contain multiple Daedra Hearts, newly respawned archers will not be missing their bows, and they will no longer stand around aimlessly if the two archers (Jesan Rilian and Merandil) are dead (they were supposed to attack the player at this point, but didn't as they couldn't see the player from their start point)</li>
<li>In the Unfriendly Competition quest, corrected the distance that the player needs to be from Thoronir and Agarmir before they will start their meeting as it was too small, and it should no longer be interrupted by Mythic Dawn agents leaving the game stuck in cutscene mode</li>
<li>After the Wayward Knight quest, if the player does not report back to Count Andel Indarys until after the Main Quest is complete, he will no longer react as if Farwil was murdered by the player (if he wasn't) and the player will be able to collect the reward</li>
<li>Fixed four bugs in the Mages Guild Ambush quest: corrected two of the battlemage allies not having any relevant dialog if the player is discovered by the Necromancers first, the battlemages will no longer attack the Necromancers too early nor attack follower allies of the player (Knights of the Nine, Atronach familiars, Dark Brotherhood Murderers, etc.) and they will no longer persist at Silorn indefinitely when the quest is completed</li>
<li>Changed the Black Soul Gems in the Cheydinhal Recommendation quest to have no soul capacity; otherwise the player could fill them via Soul Trap, consume them via recharging or enchanting (even though they are quest items) and then be unable to complete the quest</li>
<li>The Dark Brotherhood Whispers of Death quest will now be moved to completed quests when done (it will still be running; it continues for the remainder of the game as it is after all other quests are completed)</li>
<li>Adamus Phillida's bodyguard will no longer mysteriously come back to life after committing suicide at the end of the Dark Brotherhood Permanent Retirement quest (was set to respawn)</li>
<li>Jauffre should no longer be prone to die before Baurus in the Defense of Bruma quest while the player is in the Great Gate (which is all that could be done as a bugfix, unfortunately; it's still difficult to keep both alive but each now has a similar chance of dying)</li>
<li>Activating the Shrine of Clavicus Vile after the quest is finished will no longer result in a dialog that the player's level is insufficient to do the quest (can be completed at any level by getting Umbra first)</li>
<li>The Reverse Invisibility scroll given by Ancotar in the Zero Visibility quest will no longer be a quest item when no longer required (there is a second copy that could be obtained and it would get stuck in the player's inventory)</li>
<li>In the Till Death Do They Part (Vampirism Cure) quest, Melisande should remove the cure ingredients properly from the player's inventory</li>
<li>The player will now be able to fast-travel from Fort Grief if the Caught In The Hunt quest is not running</li>
<li>The Chorrol Fighters Guild Porter will now offer repair as all the others do</li>
<li>Swapped the reversed AI packages for one of the day and night guards in the Imperial City Arboretum</li>
<li>The Imperial Legion Forester at the Inn of Ill Omen should now hit his target when practicing archery instead of always missing to the left (this may only take effect on a new game)</li>
<li>Corrected Bernadette Peneles' daily worship (Skingrad) having a duration of zero</li>
<li>Gureryne Selvilo should no longer repeatedly activate the Altar of Talos (Chorrol) during his daily worship</li>
<li>The inventory icon for Clogs will no longer be random graphic noise if Oblivion is set to anything but large texture size</li>
<li>Closed seethrough gaps visible when attacking or spellcasting in the left armpit and on the upper left arm near the elbow on both the Steel Cuirass ( Armor\Steel\M\Cuirass.nif ) and the Blackwood Cuirass ( Armor\Blackwood\M\Curiass.nif {sic} )</li>
<li>Fixed collision type on French-door prison cell doors ( PrisonCellGate01.nif ) as they were allowing projectile spells to pass through (unlike all other gate types) thus were impossible to unlock with Open spells</li>
<li>Improved the fixes for CastleLight01.nif, CastleLight01Angled.nif, CathedralCryptLight02.nif and CathedralLight01.nif (previously had no Havok collision); the chains are now Havoked so will swing if struck (a small script was attached to the light object assigning the ownership to the player as they are used in owned interior cells so Z-Grabbing them would otherwise cause a bounty, and the cathedral light was renamed to UOPCathedralLight01.nif and the light reassigned to it so that it wouldn't cause problems with the ruined lights in the Anvil Chapel of Dibella during KoTN)</li>
<li>Fixed four types of chandeliers having no flames on their candles, one type missing its light node object causing the engine to place the light source off-center, two other small placement errors on one and a texturing error on another, and also optimized their meshes (over 1K polygons per mesh) - Chandelier01-04(Off,Fake).nifs, 12 files in total)</li>
<li>The three-candle wall sconce will now cast light to the wall behind it properly ( WallSconceTriple01.nif )</li>
<li>Seven types of trees will no longer give off sparks or sound like stone when struck ( TreeCamoranParadise01/02/04.nif, TreeCottonWoodSU.nif, TreeCPSnowGum.nif, TreeSnowGumFree.nif and TreeYewForest.nif )</li>
<li>Fixed bad texturing on the underside of RockWestWealdMoss04.nif and RockWestWealdBurnt04.nif caused by out-of-bounds UV mapping co-ordinates (same as was done with RockWestWeald04.nif)</li>
<li>Fixed yet another UV mapping error causing smeared texturing on one of the common West Weald rocks ( RockWestWeald02.nif )</li>
<li>RockWestWealdMoss01.nif will no longer sound like wood when struck or walked on</li>
<li>Corrected oversized and off-center Havok collision mesh on an outdoor lamp ( IronOutdoorLampFake.nif )</li>
<li>Fixed UV mapping errors causing smeared texturing on the back of the heads of two of the hanging corpses ( HangingCorpse01.nif and HangingCorpse05.nif )</li>
<li>Fixed UV mapping errors causing smeared texturing on the top of one of the Silver Vein rocks ( SilverRock03.nif )</li>
<li>The player and others will no longer hover slightly over the floor in three Imperial City buildings (Jensine's Good as New Merchandise, Slash and Smash and Agarmir's house) due to misplaced Havok collision mesh on ICGroundFloor01.nif</li>
<li>Fixed several tears in the stairway mesh of the Bastion (IC Prison District) showing visible nothingness ( PrisonHall03.nif )</li>
<li>Closed a gap of nothingness between the base of the fireplace and the floor in several Bravil houses' mesh ( BravilHouseIntL04.nif ); mesh is also used in two houses in Sundercliff (Mehrunes' Razor DLC)</li>
<li>Closed a gap of nothingness in one of the roof supports, another small one near the stairwell furthest from the door, fixed several UV mapping errors and optimized the mesh (505KB to 281KB) of the top floor of seven IC houses ( ICTopFloor10.nif )</li>
<li>Closed a seethrough gap at the base of the fireplace, removed a strange lump in the wall in the nook behind the fireplace, closed two unclosed slightly seethrough beams and fixed numerous UV mapping errors in a common farmhouse interior ( FarmHouseInterior02.nif )</li>
<li>Closed gaps of nothingness in the ceilings of three ruined fort corner wall sections ( RFNTurn01.nif, RFRmCornerDoor2x.nif and RFRmCornerR01.nif ) and a wide doorframe section ( RFWWiden01.nif )</li>
<li>Closed gap under the columns of the wide fort door section that was often see-through if not low enough to the floor ( RFWDoorArch01.nif )</li>
<li>Fixed the Havok collision mesh on the Bravil entrance ( BravilEntanceGate01.nif) so that the columns can no longer be walked into, and optimized the mesh (from 1.58MB down to 470KB)</li>
<li>Aligned the misplaced Havok collision on the doorframes of the interior Chorrol Fighters Guild ( ChorrolFGChorrolInterior01.nif and ChorrolFightersGuildInteriorDoorJam.nif ) and optimized the mesh (2.3MB down to 1.0MB)</li>
<li>Fixed flickering caused by duplicate faces on one of the Bravil wooden tower tops ( BravilTowerTop03.nif )</li>
<li>Closed a seethrough gap at the top of Oblivion tower doors ( OblivionSmallTowerDoorInsert.nif )</li>
<li>Closed a gap between the roof eave and the roof, a missing wall panel near it, plugged the transparent end of the same roof piece and fixed smeared texturing caused by bad UV mapping on the exterior Leyawiin Fighter's Guild ( LeyawiinFightersGuildHouse.nif )</li>
<li>Closed another gap in the roof of the exterior wallhouse in the IC Prison District ( ICPrisonWallHouse02.nif )</li>
<li>Fixed UV mapping errors in the interior of Weynon Priory ( WeynonHouseInterior.nif )</li>
<li>Fixed the Mehrunes' Razor dagger's (Weapons\MehrunesRazor\dagger.nif) pommel clipping through the player's hand as the grip was too short (this mesh was present in Oblivion before the Mehrunes' Razor official plug-in so is part of the UOP rather than the UOMP)</li>
<li>Fixed the torn grain sacks found in dungeons ( DunSack01.nif ) as the grain mesh was misaligned from the sack mesh so could be seen through</li>
<li>Checked pathgrids on or near all Tamriel worldspace roads. There should be no more pathgrid changes required in future. Found:
 <ul>
  <li>Grounded a canopy-level pathgrid node in (14,18), (-4,6) three in (18,18) and three in (-24,0), a floating road node in (28,-13), two in (3,17) three in (22,31), one in (21,30), five floating nodes near the road in (17,-12), four in (19,2), one in (7,-1) and one in (12,5)</li>

</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v2.1.2 (2007-06-04)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed player Marksman skill occasionally changing due to engine bug with AOE checks (guard Marksman leveling is now done via a hardcoded list so guards added by mods will not advance in Marksman).</li>
<li>Changed the silent/invisible effect type used by the utility AOE "spells" to one not changed by other mods.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v2.1.0 (2007-05-31)</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the UOP installer to Inno Setup v5.1.12</li>
<li>Fixed tangent space on the horses' mesh causing two sharp points in their hindquarters.</li>
<li>Fixed tangent space on Spider Daedra mesh which was causing sharp edges and discoloration.</li>
<li>Fixed various UV mapping errors on an Skingrad building interior (SKMageGuildIntB.NIF).</li>
<li>Fixed bad texturing on the underside of RockWestWeald04.nif caused by out-of-bounds UV mapping co-ordinates.</li>
<li>Corrected a sharp normal and a UV mapping error on 2 barrels (MiddleBarrelOpen01.NIF, MiddleBarrelOpen02.NIF).</li>
<li>Fixed bad normals on a window for an Anvil house (AnvilHouseMC02.NIF).</li>
<li>Fixed bad normals on a few windows and removed some duplicate mesh parts causing ugly breaks for an Anvil House (anvilhousemc02.nif).</li>
<li>Fixed a quite noticeable dark blue vertex color on a dungeon cave section (RFHubTunnelA.NIF).</li>
<li>Fixed ugly sharp edges on Sheogorath's statue (DaedricStatueSheogorath01.NIF).</li>
<li>Removed the invalid light source from the Zenithar statue (StatueGodsZenithar01.NIF) that was causing the Construction Set to complain.</li>
<li>Removed pointless alpha property from the quill (Quill01.NIF).</li>
<li>Radishes will no longer appear dull and black in interiors.</li>
<li>Fixed 39 normal maps for various objects that weren't displaying properly.</li>
<li>Fixed problem with Oblivion avalanche traps going off on cell load that was introduced by the 1.2.0214 official patch (possibly due to Havok precalculation).</li>
<li>A floor candleholder (CandleStickFloor01DarkFake) found in Eugal Belette's basement in Chorrol and several fort ruins will no longer show as an error mesh (large yellow diamond with exclamation point); this was due to an incorrect mesh filename/path and was brought out by the 1.2.0214 official patch (previously the game would find the correctly named mesh elsewhere); also fixed lack of Havok collision mesh on it.</li>
<li>Fixed AI bug with NPC's with bows where if they went into combat while sleeping or preparing to sleep, they would not equip arrows so were helpless (this will fix NPC's added by mods if they are members of stock classes of which some members carry bows, but not if they carry bows added by mods).</li>
<li>Guards in all cities will no longer wear a bow and quiver by default (unless they used it in their last combat); this was also caused by the 1.2.0214 official patch.</li>
<li>Fixed lack of Light Armor as a major skill for all city guards; though all except those in the Imperial City wear Light Armor, they were not leveling up in it so were very weak on defense at higher player levels.</li>
<li>Added GetPlayerInSEWorld checks to all quests changes by the UOP; this should prevent Cyrodiil rumor topics from coming up in Shivering Isles areas.</li>
<li>Mankar Camoran should no longer (very rarely) get stuck in Cloud Ruler Temple at the start of the Miscarcand/Great Welkynd Stone subquest of the Main Quest; this will also fix existing saves.</li>
<li>Chancellor Ocato should no longer fight with Baurus and Jauffre in the Temple of the One at the conclusion of the Main Quest.</li>
<li>New dialog has been added so that the player will now be able to start the game with a custom birthsign, without getting stuck just after the birthsign choice dialog with the Emperor in the tutorial dungeon.</li>
<li>Fixed several bugs with the Corruption and Conscience (Cheydinhal) quest: Removed unlimited gold exploit by repeatedly talking to Garrus Darelliun at quest end, fixed two incorrect dialogs, and when Aldos Othran fights the guard outside his house Ulrich Leland won't attack his own guard if nearby and die causing a quest popup that the player did it and breaking the quest.</li>
<li>The player will no longer be trapped in the Arcane University campus if expelled from the Mages Guild while there.</li>
<li>In the Mages Guild Leyawiin Recommendation quest, the player will no longer be able to pickpocket Kalthar's key without talking to him, which will break the quest.</li>
<li>The Renegade Shadowscale mini-quest (Dark Brotherhood) will no longer persist indefinitely as unfinishable if Teinaava dies before conclusion, and the corpse of the Argonian Agent will no longer persist indefinitely when the quest is over.</li>
<li>The Darkness Eternal quest (Vicente Valtieri, Dark Brotherhood) will no longer remain incomplete if the player is already a vampire (this will only take effect on a new game).</li>
<li>The Arena questline will now be moved to Completed quests when it is done.</li>
<li>The player will no longer be trespassing in Drakelowe Farm during the The Vampire Cure/Till Death Us Do Part quest during the times access is required to meet with Melisande.</li>
<li>In the Fighter's Guild Hist quest, killing the Blackwood Company members Geel, Ja'Fazir and Jeetum-Ze will no longer count as murders.</li>
<li>Updated the fix making Pitcher Plants unharvestable as it appears to have not worked since the most recent official patch.</li>
<li>The Fortify Alchemy enchantment effect of the Apron of the Master Artisan, Cowl of the Druid, Mantle of the Woodsman and Ring of Wortcraft items will now work properly (NOTE: exit out of menu mode after wearing them in order for them to take effect; the Fortify Alchemy effect on the character sheet will show twice for each item and its value will be twice the true value, but this is the only way to get it to work properly).</li>
<li>The Cursed Mace (Molag Bal shrine quest) will now be an undroppable quest item until it is required to drop it.</li>
<li>The barrel and chests in Pale Pass leading to and containing the Circlet of Omnipotence will no longer respawn as this is a unique item.</li>
<li>Raised/enlarged several suspension bridge stays (two definite in -6,34 and six possible others elsewhere) that were too low to permit crossing on horseback (checked all occurrences so all of them should be high enough now)
<li>Corrected the music played in the interior cells AleswellInn, AleswellSakeepasHouse, AleswellShagolgroBumphsHouse, AnvilArvenaThelasBasement, AnvilArvenaThelasHouse, CheydinhalFightersGuild, FaregylInterior, GottleFontHouse, GottleFontPrioryMonastery, GottshawInnTavern, Greyland, HarmFolly, ICElvenGardensAdrianDecaniusHouseBasement, LordRugdumphServants, OdiilFarm, PellGateIrrokitheWidesHouse, PellGateShafayesHouse, PellGateTheSleepingMare, TempleOfTheAncestorMothFarm and TempleOfTheAncestorMothMonastery to Public type, and AnvilCastleSmugglersCave, BravilWizardsGrotto, BravilWizardsLair, DAPeryiteSmallTower01, HackdirtMarlenaBrussinersBasement, ICPalaceMausoleum and TempleOfTheAncestorMothCrypt to Dungeon type.</li>
<li>Restita Statlilia and Brielus Gawey at Chestnut Handy Stables (Imperial City) will no longer follow if the player fast-travels from this location.</li>
<li>In the Heavy Armor training quest, Malene will now properly remove the four glasses presented as a gift from the player's inventory.</li>
<li>Shameer (Skingrad) should no longer steal other NPC's food and be attacked by guards (instead of eating un-owned grapes in the vineyard he works in).</li>
<li>Enlarged the Fort Grief rotating gate switch (Caught In The Hunt quest) as many players miss it and there is no indication that it's there.</li>
<li>Corrected the condition for the Open Cities compatibility fix so that duplicates of the Anvil cathedral/cloister and Benirus Manor should no longer appear with Open Cities present.</li>
<li>Carandial should no longer park his horse in the middle of the rope bridge to Bravil's gates.</li>
<li>Arkved should no longer stand up (while sleeping) if the player leaves ArkvedsTower07, goes through at least three other cells, then returns.</li>
<li>Deleted a duplicated, underground, outside the playable area Imperial Watch in the Talos Plaza district (6,15).</li>
<li>Corrected one of the Elven Gardens Imperial Watch having arrows but no bow.</li>
<li>The player will no longer be able to jump through missing Havok collision in the upper floor of the Lonely Suitor Lodge (Bravil) and "fall out of the world".</li>
<li>The player will no longer be able to walk into a gap behind the Surilie Brothers' house (Skingrad) and get stuck there.</li>
<li>The tops of several of the ruined Ayleid towers at Hame, Nornal and Wendir will no longer be transparent.</li>
<li>Removed a transparent crossbeam attached to nothing and plugged a transparent hole in a ruined arch at Ceyatatar.</li>
<li>Aligned misaligned columns at Atatar, Sardavar Leed and Varondo that were causing the exposed sections of the tops to be transparent.</li>
<li>Reoriented the floor of the ruined Ayleid tower fixing flickering and gaps at the exterior of Fanacasecul (same as was done at Silorn).</li>
<li>Closed two gaps in the Kvatch town walls and three in the Chorrol town walls (exterior).</li>
<li>Fixed twitchy hanging lamps in the basements of the Chorrol and Skingrad Fighters Guilds, one outside Francois Motierre's house in Chorrol, in the Anvil guard barracks, in Bruma Castle Service Hall, two in Chorrol castle's towers and two in the Anvil Lighthouse.</li>
<li>Orcish Cuirasses should no longer fall through the ground when dropped.</li>
<li>Lord Lovidicus and the Pale Lady will now have Vampire Dust on their corpses when slain.</li>
<li>The three wine bottles near the Fort Grief docks can now be picked up.</li>
<li>Fixed a missing mine support crossbeam near the entrance, moved two clumps of Wisp Stalks growing underwater and several others that were improperly grounded or embedded in rocks in Fyrelight Cave.</li>
<li>One of the two coins in Vilverin Sel Sancremathi will no longer fall through the Ayleid Cask it is placed on when the other is picked up.</li>
<li>The replica Dwarven Shield will no long be standing upright halfway through its display case (meaning it would slip through onto the floor) in the Skingrad Fighters Guild.</li>
<li>Grounded three floating candles and moved a stone block embedded in a table and chair in Eugal Belette's basement (Chorrol).</li>
<li>Removed a duplicated-in-place wall light fixture, grounded a couple of candles and attached two tapestries to the wall in Bruma Chapel Hall.</li>
<li>Grounded floating pathgrid nodes on the roadway in Tamriel cells -6,18 and 5,18 which were causing NPC's to lose their way.</li>
<li>Fixed pathgrid in Tamriel cell 24,11 in and around the ruined fort (nodes were in and paths going through walls, trees and impassible rocks).</li>
<li>Flattened the ground at the city gates of Bravil, Cheydinhal, Leyawiin (both) and Skingrad; the gates would be impossible to open as they were (only flattened the exterior as a proper fortified gate would only open outwards).</li>
<li>Fixed a see-through-underside tower in the interior Cheydinhal town walls and grounded a flying Elderberry shrub (near the path to the castle).</li>
<li>Fixed the distinctive ringing tone not stopping when one of the two Nirnroots in Tamriel cell -26,2 was picked.</li>
<li>Removed duplicated-in-place objects at Echo Mine exterior (-27,9): five wine and five ale bottles, a rock, a barrel, broken barrel, broken barrel pile and two broken crates.</li>
<li>Removed duplicated-in-place objects at Broken Promises Cave exterior (-24,18): four beer and one wine bottles and three piles of fire logs.</li>

<li>Grounded two chests and moved a barrel that was out of the accessible area in Nonwyll Cavern.</li>
<li>Grounded two chests in Serpent's Trail.</li>
<li>Moved two candles embedded behind a bookshelf in the Bruma Mages Guild, and grounded (the same?) two flying candles in the destroyed Bruma Mages Guild.</li>
<li>Corrected the name of the ladder out of the Night Mother's Crypt so it no longer shows as "Ladder to Bravil to Bravil", and the Leyawiin "Mages Guild door" ("door" -> "Door").</li>
<li>Further corrected typo cell name "Llevana Nedaren's House Basement" -> "Llevana Nedaren's Basement".</li>
<li>Grounded four chests and a broken crate in Desolate Mine.</li>
<li>Corrected double space in name of clothing item "Olive Vest".</li>

<li>Corrected double spaces in cell names "Trenus Duronius' Private Quarters", "Surius Afranius' Private Quarters", "Umbacano's Attic", "Northwest Watch Tower", "Usheeja's Private Quarters" and "Dynari Amnis' Basement".</li>
<li>Corrected double space in MS40 (Vampire Cure) quest stage 30 "a cure" -> "a cure".</li>
<li>Corrected dialog in Imperial post-MQ rumors AF060 (MQ00) "the victory" -> "the great victory", Gray Fox dialog 24DA5 (topic TG11Heist) "you problems" -> "your problems", Jauffre dialog 26EA7 (Greeting) "Countess's" -> "Countess'", Martin dialog 26D6E (MQ09ArmorTopic) "Talos's" -> "Talos'", Martin dialog 37825 (MQ15MartinC) "destiny. No" -> "destiny... and no", Garrus Darelliun dialog 362AE (UlrichLelandTopic) "that money" -> "the money", Tivela Lythandas dialog 1B947 (MS14ChoiceHeard) "That's a" -> "That's just a" and Kathutet dialog 3E8F4 (MQ15) "is one" -> "is but one".</li>
<li>Imperial Battlemages at Arcane University will no longer call the player the "newest addition" if the player is the Arch-Mage.</li>

</ul>

<p class="h">v1.7.1 (2007-02-08)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the Imperial Dragon Helmet, the Havok was accidentally removed from it in v1.7.0 which made it so you couldn't pick it up anymore.</li>
<li>Fixed a typo in the folder name that caused an advertised fix to not be fixed (Textures\Menus\Icons\Cloths should of been Textures\Menus\Icons\Clothes).</li>
<li>Now that the Unofficial Official Mod Patch is out the "Compatibility Patch - DLCHorseArmor.esp" has been removed from the installer and manual versions.</li>
<li>Fixed a typo in the ArchiveInvalidation instructions and the auto ArchiveInvalidation in the installer, should be "shoes01" not "shoes".</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v1.7.0 (2007-02-01)</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated UOP installer to v5.1.9 of Inno Setup.</li>
<li>Fixed uGridsToLoad option in the installer not working.</li>
<li>Fixed misnamed NIF added in v1.6.0; should have been TentInterior01NoGround.nif NOT TentInterior01NoBottom.nif.</li>
<li>Fixed the Havok collision on the brazier (Brazier01.NIF) which allowed items to fall through it.</li>
<li>Removed a section of duplicated Havok mesh from CPMainHall01.NIF (slight performance increase in the areas where this is used).</li>
<li>Fixed oversized/undersized Havok mesh on 4 paintings (MG09Portrait01.NIF, MS51Painting02.NIF, MS51Painting03.NIF, MS51Portrait01.NIF).</li>
<li>Fixed the big hole in the inside back of the Blade helmet (BHelmet.NIF) worn by the skeletons.</li>
<li>Enabled stenciling and added Havok collision to 2 mine lamps (MLamp01.NIF and MLamp01OFF.NIF).</li>
<li>Fixed ugly pixellated edges of 2 rubble piles (RFRubbleHallsPile01.NIF and RFRubbleHallsPile02.NIF).</li>
<li>Fixed misaligned Havok mesh on a door (RFPitBASEDoorCrnrANIM.NIF).</li>
<li>Removed the useless light source from the WeynonDoor01.NIF (does nothing and causes the Construction Set to complain).</li>
<li>Fixed the Jade Amulet (JadeAmulet.NIF) as it had a gem in it when it shouldn't have.</li>
<li>Corrected the oversized/misaligned Havok mesh on 8 types of mushrooms (MshmBlueEntoloma01.NIF, MshmGreenStainCup01.NIF, MshmDryadSaddlePolypore01.NIF, MshmElfEup01.NIF, MshmEmeticRussula01.NIF, MshmTinderPolypore01.NIF , MshmStinkhorn01.NIF, MshmSummerBolete01.NIF).</li>
<li>Corrected the oversized Havok mesh on 9 types of plants (FloraGoldenRod01.NIF, FloraMonksHood01.NIF, FloraWaterHyacinth02.NIF, FloraWaterHyacinth01.NIF, FloraGinsengRed.NIF, FloraGinsengYellow.NIF, FloraDragonTongue.nif, FloraPrimrosePurple.NIF, FloraPrimrosePink.NIF).</li>
<li>Fixed 2 misaligned doors in the "Oblivion Citadel Door Fix.esp" (they had different names because of the references so they were missed in the realignment).</li>
<li>Removed the complex Havok mesh from 11 mushrooms (CMushroomSingle01.NIF, CMushroomSingle02.NIF, CMushroomSingle03.NIF, CMushroomSingle04.NIF, CMushrooms01.NIF, CMushrooms02.NIF, CGloShroom01.NIF, CGloShroom02.NIF, CGloShroom03.NIF , CGloShroom04.NIF, CGloShroom05.NIF) and replaced it with a simple cube since it will act exactly the same way, except there will be a slight FPS increase in the areas where the mushrooms are used.</li>
<li>Fixed undersized Havok mesh on the Frostfire Glade door (MS37FrostfireDoor.NIF).</li>
<li>The NecroClawTrap01.NIF now has the correct hit effect of stone and not of wood.</li>
<li>Smoothed jaggy edges on SewerTrashPile 02 to 04 and ARRubblePile 01 to 05.</li>
<li>Enabled stenciling on the Blackwood gauntlets (including ground version) and Dwarven gauntlets to fix visible un-textured areas.</li>

<li>Fixed texturing errors on the Minotaur Lord.</li>
<li>Fixed the moth's texture (MiscMoth01.dds), it lacked the needed alpha which resulted in it having big black chunks around the edges.</li>
<li>Added Havok meshes to RockMossWall01.NIF, RockMossWall02.NIF, RockMossWall03.NIF, RockMossWall04.NIF, RockMossEndCap01.NIF, RockMossEndCap02 .NIF, RockMossLedge01.NIF, and RockMossLedge02.NIF (even through only Ledge02 and Wall01 are used in-game might as well do the others).</li>
<li>Removed the complex Havok mesh from the Oghma Infinium and replaced it with a much more simple and performance-friendly one.</li>
<li>Fixed missing texturing on the flowers of both versions of the Motherwort plants.</li>
<li>Fixed the Grey Mare sign so it will no longer emit blood when struck.</li>
<li>Fixed bad texturing on CastleWallRiverGate01.NIF.</li>
<li>Equipped version of Blackwood Gauntlets now have gloves and not hands; Blackwood armor is just a retexture of steel armor and has gloves on them, plus the dropped version of the Blackwood Gauntlets have gloves.</li>
<li>Fixed UV mapping errors (messed up the texture in certain areas) on Imperial Dragon Gauntlets, dropped Imperial Palace Gauntlets, dropped Imperial Dragon Gauntlets, dropped Imperial Legion Gauntlets and dropped Imperial Dragon Helmet.</li>
<li>Fixed Alpha transparency on mounted Minotaur head, Nightshade plant, Foxglove plant, Arrowroot, Bergamot, Aloe Vera and 4 types of Morning Glory leaves.</li>

<li>Grounded a circular rug, barrel, dresser, night-table (very noticeable) and several slightly flying chairs, moved a barrel lost in nothingness into the interior and two paintings not attached to the wall, and aligned the miss-centered chandelier hanging rod in Silverhome-on-the-Water in Bravil.</li>
<li>Moved a sack and two bottles in wilderness cell (-14,1) that couldn't be picked up due to oversized Havok on rocks they were placed on.</li>
<li>Grounded a slightly flying chest, chest of drawers, desk, two tables and cupboard (which was also partially embedded in a wall,) raised a rug embedded in the floor, attached two tapestries to the wall, moved two goblets embedded in their table and re-aligned five misaligned ceiling light fixtures in Seridur's House (Imperial City Temple district).</li>
<li>Grounded a flying sack, two slightly flying barrels on stands, a chest and re-aligned a misaligned ceiling light fixture in Jakben Imbel's basement (Imperial City Talos Plaza).</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitles for two lines of dialog for Imperials and Argonians/Khajiit that referred to Mandil as male.</li>
<li>Fixed a mesh overlap causing distortion on a step going to the 3rd floor in the Leyawiin Fighter's Guild (LeyawiinFGInterior.NIF).</li>
<li>Sealed hole in the roof of the Imperial City prison wall house (ICPrisonWallHouse02.NIF).</li>
<li>The White Gold Tower can now seen when you fast travel to the Imperial City Talos District.</li>
<li>The White Gold Tower can now be seen from the Arcane University.</li>
<li>Fixed the Essence Drain spells (other than the lowest-level one) from the Bloodworm Helm not being added when it was worn due to script errors, and they can no longer be kept permanently</li>
<li>Fixed overlapping mesh sections in CheydinhalHouseMiddle02Interior.NIF.</li>

<li>Raised a grape bucket that was clipping into the ground at the Surilie Vineyards (SkingradSurlieVinards).</li>

<li>Fixed a typo, "Uderfrykte Matron" is now known as "Udyrfrykte Matron" also changed all occurrences of Uderfrykte in the game to Udyrfrykte.</li>

<br><br>Progress: Total playable cells=5,195, cells checked=731, cells remaining=4,464

<p class="h">v1.6.1 (2006-12-11)</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed all modifications to the Tamriel wilderness cell 3,3 (00006044) because modifying ANYTHING at all in this cell causes the local map marker bug.</li>

<ul>

<li>All the items in Satha Dalvilu's house will now all belong to her and not free for the taking anymore.</li>

<li>Corrected the hit sound/visual effects on CastleTower512Ground0Way01.NIF, CastleTower512Ground1Way.NIF and CastleTower512Mid04.NIF.</li>
<li>Pitcher plants have no ingredient to harvest so instead of creating new ingredient for it which some people might dislike we've made it un<li>harvestable (just a pretty bit of scenery now).</li>
<li>Fixed oversized collision on CastleTowerLadder01.NIF and CastleTowerDoor01.NIF</li>
<li>Corrected the typo in the name of the "Document of Puerile Banter".</li>
<li>Added full collision to the door "impDunDoor02.NIF", it lacked collision around the sides and top allowing items to potentially fall into the void.</li>
<li>Fixed bad Havok settings on the Hoe and Rake (incorrect sound effect, Havok type which allowed you to push NPC's around with it and telekinesis didn't work on it also increased Havok size to fit the Hoe).</li>

<li>Removed a strange bit of ground from around the pole in the middle of the tent interior (TentInterior01.NIF).</li>

<li>The player will no longer be able to sit on the 2 upturned chairs from the Fighters Guild quest "Drunk and Disorderly" (looks rather strange when you do).</li>
<li>Grounded a floating broken tombstone part in the Leyawiin graveyard (LeyawiinExterior24).</li>
<li>The Cheydinhal Guard involved in the "Corruption and Conscience" quest will no longer be essential after he has served his purpose.</li>

<li>Removed a redundant wall section from the Bravil castle court yard also fully joined a wall section that wasn't (BravilCastle01).</li>
<li>Fixed 4 seams in BravilCastleKeepGate01.NIF and 5 seams in BravilCastleKeepWall01.NIF.</li>
<li>Removed the unseeable Imperial Palace base from the districts around the Imperial Palace; possible framerate increase (was advertised as done in v1.5.0 but was not actually done).</li>
<li>Added missing distant LOD to the Arcane University.</li>
<li>Added missing glow maps to the blue, light blue and green Welkynd Stones.</li>

<li>Aligned misaligned Havok collision object on HangingCorpse02.NIF, CathedralStenIntFloor05.NIF and CastleTowerDoor01Anim.NIF.</li>
<li>Removed alpha property from Leeks (CropLeek.NIF) and 10 Ayleid vines (texture wasn't setup for alpha so it's just a waste of resources.</li>
<li>Fixed alpha on the menu icons of Quill, Brush Jar, Planter (MiddleClassPlanter) and 2 types of folded cloth (FoldedCloth02 & FoldedCloth03); improper alpha was noticeable with a custom UI with a different background color.</li>
<li>Re-added the refraction effect back to the Sigil Stone that was accidentally removed.</li>
<li>Fixed sound played when opening an Oblivion door (CitadelHallDoor01Anim.NIF); the sound was played quite a distance away from the actual door (As a result all instances of this door in-game have had to be repositioned, so it has been made separate from the UOP).</li>
<li>Fixed alpha on the vines of ARStatue01.NIF, ARStatueSmall01.NIF, ARVineArch01.NIF, ARVineGrowontop.NIF, TreeDeadLeaves01.NIF and TreeDeadLeaves02.NIF.</li>
<li>Wabbajack will no longer "kill" Mehrunes Dagon (as was intended, but the scripting to prevent this didn't work).</li>
<li>Corrected Havok collision object for the ground of the Imperial City Arena; NPC's and objects were sinking into it.</li>
<li>Corrected alpha and stenciling on Kvatch tapestries.</li>
<li>Corrected stenciling on one of the statues in the Arena district.</li>
<li>Fixed reversed texturing on Pumpkin plants (bottom pumpkin's texture was being used on the top one and vice versa).</li>
<li>Eliminated graphical clipping of the flame cap on the equippable torch (Torch02.NIF).</li>
<li>Absorb Maximal Magicka scrolls will now use the correctly leveled enchantment (not that of Absorb Major Magicka).</li>
<li>The level 5-9 version of the Mage's Staff of Dispel will now have the correct enchantment charge magnitude (960 rather than 560).</li>
<li>Corrected the Speed and Reach values for all Elven War Axes.</li>
<li>The Dire Enervation (Journeyman Drain Fatigue) spell will now have the correct duration, and the Flame Shield (Journeyman Fire Shield) the correct duration and magnitude, which makes them a Journeyman (not Expert and Master) level spells as they were supposed to be.</li>
<li>Several versions of the Spelldrinker Amulet will now have the correct worn and ground meshes (not the Necromancer's Amulet or Amulet of Kings)
<li>Superior Dispel scrolls will now have the correct name (not "Superior Self").</li>
<li>Corrected weights of Dremora Field, Broadhead and Barbed Arrows (all weights were 10x what they should be given their damage in comparison with other arrows).</li>
<li>Corrected weight, reach, health and damage values for the Mace of Decay, as they appeared to have been copied from the Warhammer of Decay.</li>
<li>Corrected the magnitude of the Fortify Armorer enchantment of Base Ring of the Armorer and Gauntlets of the Forge, the Fortify Athletics enchantment of the Boots of the Taskmaster and Grand Ring of Athletics, and the Fortify Security enchantment of the Gauntlets of Passing.</li>
<li>Corrected typos in name of weapon "Thieve's Dagger", activator "Shine of Malacath" and armors "Cuirass of the Cameleon" and "Helmet of Spell Resistence".</li>
<li>Arena opponents in heavy armor will now carry Orcish (heavy) instead of Elven (light) shields for levels 10-14.</li>
<li>Fixed the Ring of the Viper Eye (Lifting the Vale quest reward) so that it is made a non-quest item if it has not yet been obtained (it should never have been a quest item at all).</li>
<li>Llathasa's bust (Thieves Guild Elven Maiden quest) and Lithnilian's Research Notes (No Stone Unturned quest) will no longer remain quest items when their quests are complete.</li>
<li>Possibly fixed the problem with Armand Christophe getting stuck and never showing up at the Garden of Dareloth after the Elven Maiden quest (added a simple can't-hurt-might-help EvaluatePackage to the right area, but eight times asking for a save to test it on failed to produce results so unable to test it).</li>
<li>In the Fighter's Guild "More Unfinished Business" quest, Aryarie will now give the correct reward ring (the stats. are the same) and it will now be removed from her inventory.</li>
<li>An unbroken player-safe cabinet container in Benirus Manor now will be part of the restored, not the haunted, manor so may be used by the player, also corrected a duplicated-in-place pair of gold-trimmed shoes and grounded a flying dresser and the objects on it.</li>
<li>Corrected texture on male Green Velvet Shoes (also removed a double space from their display name); fix had not been included as indicated in previous UOP's but it will be there now.</li>
<li>Goblin Shaman Staffs should no longer fall through the ground when dropped.</li>
<li>Made added Anvil exterior-view buildings (cathedral, cloister and Benirus Manor) compatible with future releases of Open Cities Complete; the unneeded buildings will not appear if Open Cities Complete is present.</li>
<li>The inscription on the gravestone of Melus Petilius' wife (Molag Bal Shrine quest) will no longer face away from the side where he kneels.</li>
<li>Grounded the slightly flying For Sale sign in front of Arborwatch and a slightly flying shrub, and raised the land slightly under an ungrounded wall and lowered another wall in Chorrol.</li>
<li>Grounded many slightly floating trash piles in the Imperial Sewer Southeast and Beneath the Bloodworks areas.</li>
<li>Closed a gap between the wall and tower and moved the land up so that the wall buttresses weren't floating over the water at Cheydinhal's East Gate.</li>

<li>Raised the land slightly under a bridge post in wilderness (8,2) so it is embedded in the riverbed.</li>
<li>Raised the land slightly under an Ayleid wall at Miscarcand that was partially off the ground.</li>

<li>Removed a duplicated cauldron of skulls and three skulls on sticks at the exterior of Exhausted Mine.</li>
<li>Grounded two flying stone blocks, also moved a hanging corpse and its clip to be centered properly in Peryite's Oblivion plane.</li>

<li>In the quest "Through a Nightmare, Darkly" Lucien Lachance will no longer appear in Henantier's Dreamworld, interrupting Henantier's conversation and making the quest unfinishable (and trapping the player there).</li>
<li>The Bloodworm Helm and Necromancer's Amulet removed by Arch-Mage Traven will now be retrievable later by the player (several good reasons: he indicates they will be hidden in the tower, they are both leveled items, and their quest item status was being removed at quest end, so they appear to have been intended for player use and their eventual return was overlooked; as well they can be used by the player indefinitely before returning them to complete the quest, and if they were mere "quest items" would not have been useful at all); they will also appear on a save with the quest completed.</li>

<li>In the Mages Guild Necromancer's Amulet quest, if the player kills the allies of Caranya while in Sneak mode or otherwise undetected, this will no longer result in Murder stat. increases, and they will also no longer put on their Necromancer robes if they're dead.</li>
<li>The Dark Guardian should no longer leave the Cheydinhal Dark Brotherhood sanctuary as was unable to get back in, and if killed outside would respawn outside for the remainder of the game (as well, its attempts to go back in through the well have been occasionally reported to crash the game).</li>
<li>Signy Home-Wrecker (Sirens' Deception quest) should no longer prematurely attack the player in the Flowing Bowl just for unsheathing a weapon.</li>
<li>The "Note from Gray Fox" (Thieves Guild Misdirection quest) will now become droppable when the quest is completed (it would be stuck if the player retrieved it later from the Arch-Mage's nightstand).</li>
<li>In the Thieves Guild Arrow of Extrication quest, beggars will now provide information on Fathis Aren correctly based on player disposition and/or previous bribes.</li>
<li>Shrouded Armor (which includes gauntlets) will now hide the player's rings.</li>

<li>The torches/braziers on the Skingrad Castle, Talos and Arcane University bridges will now cast light onto the area.</li>
<li>One of the cells in Pothole Caverns will no longer show erroneous "red hand" trespass ownership.</li>
<li>Closed a small seam in the Skingrad town walls.</li>
<li>Fixed the swinging mace trap in Rockmilk Cave (one mace would swing wildly when activated due to collision with nearby root).</li>

</ul>

<p class="h">v1.4.0 (2006-09-04)</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed 4 fixed NIF's from the Unofficial Oblivion Patch due to performance impacts caused by them, if you are using the Installer Version use the uninstaller to remove them as for the Manual Version do a file search on your Oblivion for the following files and delete them: ICWall01.NIF, ICWall02.NIF, ICTalosWallHouse01.NIF and ICAUWallHouse01.NIF.</li>
<li>The manual-install version of the Unofficial Patch will be a 7-Zip/.7z file from now on; it is getting too large to use outmoded, inefficient ZIP compression. 7-Zip is available from http://www.7-zip.org and it is completely free of charge. WinRAR, PowerArchiver, and other popular archiving programs, but of course not WinZip, can also unpack this format.</li>
<li>Using "tweaks" to disable specular highlighting (such as setting bDoSpecularPass=0 in Oblivion.ini) should no longer crash the game to desktop, so the "Specular Fix" mod that breaks several activators should no longer be required.</li>
<li>Corrected jaggy and flickering on the entrance door to Two Sisters (Leyawiin).</li>
<li>Fixed distortion on icons for some male lower-class clothing items for some players.</li>
<li>Corrected sound effect for fifteen door types when struck with a weapon.</li>
<li>Removed mipmaps from all versions of the Cowl of the Gray Fox icon (Helmet.dds) to stop distortion of the icon if your textures are set lower than largest</li>
<li>Corrected sound effect for three wall shelf types, and also fixed their slightly oversized collision object.</li>
<li>Oversized collision object on three types of table will no longer cause collisions with objects passing under them (most noticeable in Arkved's tower where arrows intended to go between the oversized table legs would get stuck in the nothingness).</li>
<li>The Telekinesis effect will no longer fail to work on multiple types of keys (Key02.NIF), letters (Parchment01.NIF), broad sheets (BroadSheet01.NIF), and Flawed Topazes.</li>
<li>Corrected collision type for Gray Fox wanted posters so it doesn't appear Telekinesis will pick them up (it won't).</li>
<li>Corrected the undersized, misaligned collision object for all types of Cutlasses.</li>
<li>Re-aligned misaligned collision object for Wolf Pelts.</li>
<li>Corrected oversized collision object on both types of Sapphires.</li>
<li>Added missing collision object to a common type of rock (CHRock165.NIF) so the player and other things will no longer fall through it.</li>
<li>Corrected the collision object on four other types of rocks as they did not match the shape of the rock.</li>
<li>Corrected hi-poly collision object on Pearls; replaced mesh of nearly a thousand vertices with a simple sphere for a noticeable FPS increase if there are many Pearls onscreen.</li>
<li>Corrected the collision object on lockpicks, and they will now use the proper sound/hit effects.</li>
<li>Tweaked 29 types of plants to remove (or greatly reduce) the very ugly alpha-clipping on the edges.</li>
<li>Texturing on five types of rugs will no longer discolor their tassels.</li>
<li>Corrected jagginess/pixilation on four types of rugs found in Kvatch.</li>
<li>Corrected bad joining mesh in one of the cave tunnel pieces between a stalagmite and a stalactite and their bases.</li>
<li>Fixed visible seams between low retaining walls in the Imperial City Prison District and the ground.</li>
<li>Corrected the hair on the Mother's Head item as it was the same untextured pixellated blackness that Zombie hair was.</li>
<li>Corrected texturing on Bear Pelts (the texture was on the inside so had no depth).</li>
<li>Corrected a miss-aligned wall section and door in Roderic Pierrane's Private Quarters (ICElvenGardensRodericPierranesUpstairs) which caused a rather huge gap.</li>
<li>Grounded 2 floating rocks outside Fanacas (FanacasExterior 31,28).</li>
<li>A chest in the Black Wood Company will no longer belong to the Black Bow or for that matter anyone else as no other objects have ownership in that area.</li>
<li>Fixed another very sunken Motherwort and a slightly sunken Motherwort near the Isolated House (OBGateRandW007).</li>
<li>The water is now visible at the base of a waterfall in the wilderness (-1,-2).</li>
<li>Corrected the water flow direction of the waterfall in the wilderness (-2,-3).</li>
<li>Moved a elderberry bush out of a rock also moved a nightshade plant out of the water in the wilderness (-1,-1).
<li>Enabled stenciling (draws on both sides) on the leaves of the living and dead Spiddal plants, leaves shouldn't just "vanish" because you're looking at it from a different angle.</li>
<li>Corrected texture for silver short sword and dagger so their holster's appear as it should of been.</li>
<li>Dorian should sleep in his own bed upstairs now.</li>

<li>Grounded 10 floating trees in the wilderness (-26,23).</li>
<li>Grounded 3 floating trees in the wilderness (-27,25).</li>
<li>Grounded a floating tree in the wilderness (-17,26).</li>
<li>Moved a tree out of a rock near an oblivion gate (ObGateRandVM003 5,40).</li>
<li>Grounded a tree in the wilderness (-3,31).</li>
<li>Fixed 5 see-through rocks in the wilderness (8,42).</li>
<li>Fixed 2 see-through rocks in the wilderness (7,42).</li>
<li>Grounded floating shrub in the wilderness (25,34).</li>
<li>Grounded 2 slightly floating shrubs in the wilderness (38,28).</li>
<li>Moved tree out of a rock in the wilderness (48,2).</li>
<li>Grounded a floating tree in the wilderness (43,5).</li>
<li>Moved 2 trees that where embedded in a rock in the wilderness (43,11).</li>
<li>Fixed a see-through rock in the wilderness (-21,37).</li>
<li>Grounded 3 floating trees and a see-through rock in the wilderness (-19,38).</li>
<li>Grounded 3 floating trees in the wilderness (-18,38).</li>
<li>Grounded 3 floating trees in the wilderness (-18,39).</li>
<li>Grounded 6 floating trees in the wilderness (-22,38).</li>
<li>Grounded a floating tree in the wilderness (11,-9).</li>
<li>Moved a monkshood that was embedded in a rock in the wilderness (10,-7).</li>
<li>Moved a nightshade that was embedded in a rock in the wilderness (1,-7).</li>
<li>Moved a bush that was embedded in a rock in the wilderness (0,8).</li>
<li>Grounded a floating tree in the wilderness (0,-8).</li>
<li>Created a better fix for the wraith death animation bug.</li>
<li>The bodies of wraiths, wraith lords, and ghosts will no longer act as "speed bumps" and sometimes block access to areas.</li>
<li>Adjusted a little section of terrain in Bruma to stop seeing up inside a wall section (BrumaExterior07 5,34).</li>
<li>Removed an ugly square ground texturing from Bravil.</li>
<li>Fixed yet another quest breaking bug involving Springheel Jak's diary.</li>
<li>In the Vampirism Cure quest, Hal-Liurz should no longer fail to bring Count Janus Hassildor nor become stuck in the Chamber of the Lost due to broken one-day timer dependent on the time of day (which can also break other quests that rely on her such as Allies for Bruma).</li>
<li>In the Thieves Guild Taking Care Of Lex quest, The Stranger should no longer indefinitely say that the documents are not ready due to broken one-day timer dependent on the time of day.</li>
<li>In the Thieves Guild Turning a Blind Eye quest, the Ancestor Moths topic will no longer be available from beggars when it is not needed anymore; choosing the quest topic after completion could set the quest backwards, preventing Amusei from showing up to start the next quest, thus breaking the remaining quest line.</li>
<li>In the Thieves Guild Ultimate Heist Quest, activating the Glass of Time before getting the quest items from the Gray Fox will no longer break the quest.</li>
<li>In the Paradise sub-quest of the Main Quest, Kathutet's body will no longer disappear; if the player did not retrieve the Bands of the Chosen before this happened it would trap the player in Paradise and break the remainder of the Main Quest.</li>
<li>As well, repairing the Bands of the Chosen to over 100% (if the player has 75 or higher skill in Armorer) will no longer allow them to be removed.</li>
<li>In the Blood of the Divines sub-quest of the Main Quest, the undead Blades will no longer follow the player outside of Sancre Tor; if they were killed outside, their ghosts were unable to get back in, which would break the remainder of the Main Quest.</li>
<li>The Molag Bal Shrine quest will no longer cause the player to lose racial, birth sign and vampiric attributes and powers. On load of an affected savegame, missing attributes and powers will be restored.</li>
<li>Further corrected/improved the Go Fish quest; Rumare Slaughterfish # 7 was not initially disabled which threw off the compass marker and the quest.</li>
<li>Raminus Polus will now recognize Bloodcrust Vampire Dust when the player is trying to regain Mages Guild entry after suspension (Note: if the quest is already running when you install UOP v1.4, if Raminus doesn't recognize when you have all of the ingredients, just wait 5 seconds and talk to him again).</li>
<li>The enchanted chest in the Arch-Mage's quarters will now duplicate the ingredients: Cheese Wheel, Cinnabar Polypore Red Cap, Foxglove Nectar, Green Stain Shelf Cap, Orange, Potato, Root Pulp, Shepherd's Pie, and Taproot. There was no good reason why they were left out as they are neither otherworldly, nor unique in their properties, nor quest items, as other omitted ingredients are.</li>
<li>Candice Corgine of the Sleeping Mare (Pell's Gate) will now rent rooms and have barter gold as she was supposed to.</li>
<li>The player will now receive a warning/confirmation dialog upon eating a Poisoned Apple, as the similarity of controls (click vs. Shift-click) made it too easy to accidentally eat one when trying to drop it (the apple will return on exiting menu mode, but if the player continues to eat apples on purpose without exiting the inventory screen they will be lost).</li>
<li>The four members of the Black Hand (Dark Brotherhood, Following A Lead quest) will no longer call the player a thief if items in Applewatch farm are picked up.</li>
<li>The guard at Bravil's North Gate on the west side of the door should no longer constantly walk into the wall behind him; his inability to reach his target point was also preventing him from doing his patrols.</li>
<li>Improved the fix for Countess Alessia Caro so that she is susceptible to Stark Reality (Sanguine Shrine quest) if she has been resurrected, and removed unused if blocks and unnecessary checks from the Stark Reality spell script as it was very slow (If the quest is currently running and Alessia Caro is already at the dinner party, and the spell isn't working on her, she may have been resurrected by the UOP; just come back in a back in a day and it will work).</li>
<li>Corrected exploit of killing Raven Camoran repeatedly in Paradise and obtaining his leveled ring every time (this was clearly an oversight as it and other items are removed from him when he is first moved to Paradise; there was no equivalent for Ruma Camoran and her leveled staff so this was left alone).</li>
<li>Removed several unused variables from Delmar's scripting for the Mage's Staff.</li>
<li>The body of Agarmir will no longer persist indefinitely after the Unfriendly Competition quest is completed, nor the bodies of Aenvir, Dranas Lerano and Storn The Burly when the Spies (Fighters Guild) quest is completed, nor the body of Matthias Draconis when the Next of Kin (Dark Brotherhood) quest is completed.</li>
<li>The four residents of the Bravil Skooma Den should no longer all try to sleep in the same bed while others go unused.</li>
<li>Corrected reversed leveled enchantments for the level 15-20 and 20+ versions of Valdemar's Shield.</li>
<li>The Chapel of Dibella (Anvil) and ruined Chapel of Akatosh (Kvatch) will no longer be missing when viewed from outside their respective towns' walls.</li>
<li>As well, added other distinctive buildings to Anvil's outside view that were missing.</li>
<li>The base of statues in the Imperial City and other towns will no longer disappear before their statue when the player is distant, making it appear the statue is floating.</li>
<li>The player's rings will no longer show through Inquisitor's Gauntlets and Gauntlets of the Sentinel.</li>
<li>The player's amulets will no longer show through the Dondoran's Juggernaut and Birthright of Astalon cuirasses.</li>
<li>Magebane Greaves will no longer hide the player's rings.</li>
<li>Boots of the Unburdened will no longer hide the player's amulets.</li>
<li>One of the two spiked-ball traps in Fort Blueblood should now activate properly.</li>
<li>A stalagmite and two stalactites in Sinkhole Cave should no longer disappear at certain angles due to alpha-channel conflict with two cobwebs.</li>
<li>Improved fix for Belletor's Folly Cavern by correcting pathing grids.</li>
<li>A non-activating chest of drawers in the Leyawiin Coast Guard Station should now activate properly.</li>
<li>Corrected misaligned doors to the upstairs of the Merchant's Inn (Imperial City Market District) and Luther Broad's Boarding House (Talos Plaza District) allowing visible nothingness beyond them (also fixed another door in Luther Broad's that was badly centered).</li>
<li>Corrected three off-centered doors in Ontus Vanin's house (Imperial City Talos Plaza).</li>
<li>Raised a rectangular rug in Leyawiin Castle Private quarters that had its tassels sunk into the floor (see above; may have been done to hide the discolored tassels) causing flickering, and reoriented another whose tassels were sticking through the wall.</li>
<li>Removed grey alpha-channel clipping line around the shrine at Sancre Tor Tomb.</li>
<li>Closed three disjointed underwater seams between outdoor cells near Arcane University.</li> 
<li>Grounded two extremely flying Azaleas, seven slightly flying see-through-underside trees, one flying Mandrake, and one flying rock, and corrected a see-through rock around Bawn.</li>
<li>Reoriented three very large, very see-through boulders (also moved a bush out of the way for one) and grounded a see-through-underside tree near Vaermina's Shrine.</li>
<li>Reoriented a see-through rock and grounded three slightly floating Bergamot plants near Arkved's Tower.</li>
<li>Reoriented two see-through-underside rocks and grounded three see-through-underside trees near Nornal.</li>
<li>Reoriented a see-through underside rock near Memorial Cave.</li>
<li>Grounded two slightly flying chests in Lost Boy's Yawning Halls, and a flying (and backwards) chest in Fatback Cave.</li>
<li>Grounded a slightly floating Azalea (and moved it out of a rock) and a slightly floating Maple tree near the Imperial Prison sewer exit.</li>
<li>Grounded a see-through-underside tree near Timberscar Hollow, three near Newt Cave, and two near Fanacasecul.</li>
<li>Reoriented/grounded a see-through rock just north of Anvil.</li>
<li>Grounded a very flying tree and several see-through underside trees, and moved several deeply embedded trees out of rocks in The Painted World (Brush With Death quest).</li>
<li>Lowered 110 Lily pads to the water's surface in a pond near Fort Roebuck.</li>
<li>Grounded three slightly flying Foxgloves and a mushroom outside Bravil Castle.</li>
<li>Grounded a see-through underside Cypress tree and two clumps of Cypress Knees, grounded four slightly flying rocks, and moved two mushrooms and about twenty rocks out of the ground near Blankenmarch.</li>
<li>Attached two floating Red Cinnabar Polypores to their tree near Mortal Camp.</li>
<li>Grounded Cypress trees and Knees near Fort Blueblood and Fort Doublecross.</li>
<li>Grounded three clusters of slightly flying Cypress Knees near Amelion Tomb.</li>
<li>Grounded two slightly flying rocks (and reoriented on that was see-through) and a slightly flying tree near Fort Variela.</li>
<li>Grounded two moderately flying rocks near Veyond Cave, and two near Newt Cave.</li>
<li>Grounded three slightly flying rocks, moved two from deep underground, and moved a Monkshood out of a rock near Sancre Tor.</li>

<li>Grounded three slightly flying Milk Thistles, raised two that were deep underground, and grounded a slightly flying tree outside Ninendava.</li>
<li>The player should no longer be notified of the addition of the non-existent "Do you need couriers?" dialog topic (this topic links to nothing, never appears in dialog with anyone and appears to have been put there for a quest that was never developed).</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle of Mages Guild conversation about Kud-Ei that indicated she runs the Bruma Mages Guild instead of Bravil.</li>
<li>Corrected audio and subtitle of two lines of NPC conversation that referred to Rohssan (Imperial City Market District, A Fighting Chance) as male.</li>

</ul>

<p class="h">v1.3.0 (2006-08-15)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a little terrain error caused by fixing the gap under the arena main gate.</li>
<li>The Glass Ceremonial Gauntlets will now appear properly on female characters.</li>
<li>Created a new normal map for the Escutcheon of Chorrol as the existing one wasn't working and was of poor quality too, so now it matches the ebony shield.</li>
<li>Fixed Wraith death animation bug (Wraith and Wraith Lord) where they didn't collapse down into a pile of rags when they died sometimes.</li>
<li>Fixed the collision on dead Wraith (Wraith Lord as well) and Ghosts, the wraith only had a little cube of collision around player height before which created a little impassable wall (definitely possible to block yourself in with dead wraith).</li>
<li>Fixed the collision of 3 bookshelves (UpperWallShelf01.NIF, UpperWallShelf02.NIF & UpperWallShelf03.NIF), in certain places books/other items could fall through (properly was the cause of the "exploding book shelf" too).</li>
<li>Fixed the missing stain glass texture on the ceiling of the Imperial Palace Library, Bethesda had the texture name wrong so that's why it never appeared.<li>
<li>The "Olroy Cheese" will no longer fall out of the cooking pot.</li>
<li>Corrected the door sounds of the wooden doors in the Imperial Palace (ICPalaceIntLoadDoor01 and ICPalaceAnimDoor01) as they weren't using the right sounds.</li>
<li>Fixed a sunken Motherwort and 2 slightly floating barrels near the Isolated House (OBGateRandWW007).</li>
<li>Grounded a floating tree in the wilderness (24,7).</li>
<li>Repositioned a rock that you could see inside of in the wilderness (24,6).</li>
<li>Fixed a badly miss-aligned door in the private quarters north wing of castle Bravil.</li>
<li>Fixed terrain clipping through the ground near the an entrance door in the Talos Plaza District in the Imperial City (ICTalosPlazaDistrict06).</li>
<li>Fixed the player's statue in Bruma so now it won't be possible for it to drop dead, vanish or face become messed up (if you are already afflicted with any of these bugs it won't be fixed).</li>
<li>Grounded a pile of floating mushrooms in the Imperial City Arboretum District.</li>
<li>Grounded a floating tree in the wilderness (43,9).</li>
<li>Grounded 3 floating rocks in the wilderness (31,14).</li>

<li>Grounded a floating mat along with all the other object floating with it in Aleron Loche's house at Bravil.</li>
<li>Grounded 2 floating bushes & 1 rock also move 2 rocks and 1 bush out of the ground which where too far under in the wilderness (-21,24).</li>
<li>Grounded a floating way shrine alter in the wilderness (-32,14).</li>
<li>Grounded a floating rock at Fort Aurus (FortAurusExterior).</li>
<li>Grounded 2 floating rock in the wilderness (25,3).</li>
<li>Ground a pile of floating mushrooms and moved 2 out of a rock near Peryite's Shrine (PeryiteShrineExterior).</li>
<li>The Paranoia quest will no longer start back up again if you decided to kill Glarthir then the 3 people he wanted you to go after.</li>
<li>Arnora Auria's body will no longer persist.</li>
<li>Removed the "tail" from the ground mesh version of the Brusef Amelion's Helmet as the equipped version didn't have one neither did the inventory icons.</li>
<li>The Ayleid Cask containing the Ayleid Crown of Lindai will no longer respawn allowing you to get multiple copies of the crown.</li>
<li>Quite a few silver weapons will now actually ignore normal weapon resistance like silver weapons should.</li>
<li>Fixed the fix for the Boethiah Shrine quest (Tournament of Ten Bloods) for Argonian players as the exit portal was failing to open; also corrected duplicate voiceovers so it should be perfect now.</li>
<li>In the Thieves Guild Ultimate Heist quest, the Imperial Library monks should no longer go into combat when the player sits in the Reading Chair, locking the controls (Note: many instances of problems with this quest are due to the fact that when the player sits in the chair Sneak mode ends, and the engine won't allow the player to stand up in combat mode. Go into Sneak as soon as seated to avoid detection, and stand up in Sneak before getting the scroll to allow escape if detected picking it up.).</li> 
<li>Corrected oversight of the door to the Old Way (Thieves Guild Ultimate Heist quest) not being initially disabled, which meant the player didn't have to activate the Glass Of Time as indicated; bypassing this stage and going directly to the sewers could get the quest out of order, and if the door was found before getting quests from the Gray Fox it would break the entire remainder of the questline.</li>
<li>At the conclusion of the Confront the King (Mages Guild) quest, Mannimarco should not remain invulnerable in the battle with him nor stand around after the conversation and refuse to start fighting.</li>
<li>In the quest to join the Mages Guild, the player will now be able to receive a recommendation from Chorrol as indicated if the quest item Fingers of the Mountain was initially given to Earana but then properly returned to Teekeeus, and won't receive a recommendation if the item wasn't returned at all.</li>
<li>Corrected several quest arrows for the preceding Mages Guild quest and others.</li>
<li>In the Caught in the Hunt quest, retrieving the key from Kurdan gro-Dragol's corpse before getting the popup to do so will no longer make the quest unfinishable. On load of a savegame in this state, the quest will be advanced to the proper stage.</li> 
<li>In the Dark Brotherhood Permanent Retirement quest, killing Adamus Phillida with the Rose of Sithis will no longer result in a bounty if the player is undetected.</li>
<li>Also in the same quest, the Rose of Sithis should no longer fail to work if Adamus Phillida is not wearing his armor.</li>
<li>The Mora's Soul Trap spell (Hermaeus Mora Shrine Quest) will no longer fail if cast more than once on the same NPC, breaking the quest. On load of an affected savegame the spell will be reset allowing the quest to be completed.</li>
<li>Corrected Countess Alessia Caro being set to non-essential after the Thieves Guild Ahdarji's Heirloom quest; she would occasionally die on the way from Leyawiin to Chorrol and back and this would break the Sanguine Shrine quest. She will now be made unessential once both quests are completed, and essential if both are not; if she is dead in a current game without both quests complete she will reappear in Leyawiin or Chorrol depending on the day of the month.</li>
<li>Delphine Jend of the Bravil Mages Guild will no longer carry a dummy item in her inventory called "&lt;Missing name&gt;" which if picked up can become undroppable, or even crash the game to desktop.</li>
<li>Vicente Valtieri (Dark Brotherhood, Cheydinhal) will now only have the topic to cure vampirism if the player already has it, and selecting this topic will properly advance the vampirism cure quest.</li>
<li>The bodies of Black Brugo, Alonzo and Roxy Aric (Black Bow Bandits), Baurus, Burd and Jauffre (Main quest), and Arnora Auria (Two Sides of the Coin quest) will no longer persist indefinitely when their quests are complete.</li>
<li>Garridan's Tears should no longer fall through the ground or rock they sit on when the first one is picked up, thus breaking the quest to retrieve them.</li>
<li>The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal should no longer fall through the floor when dropped.</li>
<li>Cingor (Leyawiin) will no longer be a Mythic Dawn member, as killing him in self-defense would kick the player out of the Fighters Guild.</li>
<li>Corrected flickering texture in Bravil Castle Private Quarters bedroom caused by a rug hidden in the floor.</li>

<li>Moved the land up so you can't see under the pillars at Fort Naso (FortNasoexterior 38,1) anymore.</li>
<li>Turned on Auto-Calculate spell cost for Finger of the Mountain. The higher level spell versions costed huge amounts of magicka to cast and with the other reward spells I've seen they actually have a lower cast cost then Auto-Calculate so why are these spell so high?</li>

<li>Corrected pixellated jaggy Ayleid wrought-iron door texture on the Ultimate Heist (Thieves Guild) Keyhole Pillar to match the fix for the square Ayleid doors.</li>
<li>When the player is joining the Thieves Guild, Amusei should no longer fail to show up in the Garden of Dareloth (Imperial City Waterfront) and instead be hiding in the Leyawiin castle dungeon, thus breaking the quest line (caused by picking the furthest cell's lock in the Leyawiin dungeon before joining the Thieves Guild).</li>
<li>In the Thieves Guild Lost Histories/Atonement quest, Amusei will not disappear through cell transitions when being rescued from Castle Skingrad's dungeon.</li>
<li>Also in the same quest, corrected selected Skingrad town guards but not castle guards avoiding the escaping player and Amusei; close proximity to the only two escape routes made it nearly impossible to complete the quest without a large bounty.</li>
<li>If the player finds the Great Welkynd Stone in Miscarcand before being given the quest by Martin, this will no longer cause him to go to battle in the Defense of Bruma sub-quest of the Main Quest equipped with only his priest's robe and iron dagger, which greatly increases the chance of him dying (also his name did not change to "Martin Septim").</li>
<li>Killing Azani Blackheart without Modryn Oreyn present will no longer break the associated Fighter's Guild quest.</li>
<li>At the conclusion of the quest When The Vow Breaks, Maeva the Buxom will now recognize multiple Rockshatter maces (leftover from bug fixed by the 1.1.511 patch) in the player's inventory and will remove all of them (there was only ever supposed to be one); also if the quest has already been completed any remaining Rockshatter's will become non-quest items thus will have normal weight and may be sold.</li>

<li>Fixed Vidkun's body missing from the Cheydinhal Mages Guild Well (Recommendation Quest) for pre-patch savegames; on load, Vidkun's body will reappear in the well so that the quest can be completed.</li>
<li>The Boots of Springheel Jak will now only advance their quest (causing the Gray Fox to appear) if the quest is actually running, as they can be obtained from Jakben Earl of Imbel outside the quest without using the console; as well new dialog has been added so that they can be given to the Gray Fox at the time that the quest is given if the player already has them, and they will now be removable from player inventory when the quest is completed.</li>
<li>In the Thieves Guild Ahdarji's Heirloom quest, Hlidara Mothril (countess' handmaiden) will be set to essential/un-killable, and if she is already dead on load she will reappear in Leyawiin or Chorrol depending on the day of the month, as she would occasionally die on the journey between the two locations; she will also become non-essential at quest end.</li>
<li>Also in the Ahdarji's Heirloom quest, dialog topics regarding the ring will not improperly advance so be available without the player being given any information as to what it is.</li>

<li>For existing pre-1.1.511 patch savegames with one or more copies of Ahdarji's Ring stuck in player inventory, on load they will become non-quest items so can be gotten rid of.</li>
<li>Corrected broken timers in scripting for vampirism and also removed unnecessary variables, which fixes the following bugs: the player will become a vampire when resting a minimum of three days after contracting Porphyric Hemophilia (which is what was supposed to happen, not immediately after contracting the disease) feeding and then immediately resting or waiting for less than 24 hours will no longer cause the player to change state from 25% to 50% (a minimum of 24 hours is supposed to happen between state changes) and the higher-level states of vampirism (75% and 100%) will be accessible (whereas before they were dependent on the time of day of resting due to the broken timers.) On load of save of a player with Porphyric Hemophilia who has not yet rested, the broken day counter will be reset to zero allowing three days before vampirism occurs.</li>
<li>In the Till Death Do Us Part (vampirism cure) quest, Melisande should no longer remain indefinitely in her basement preparing the cure due to broken timer dependent on the time of day and day of the month that the ingredients were presented.</li>
<li>In The Dark Brotherhood quest "A Watery Grave", the player will no longer be able to hide in the open packing crate while on horseback, trapping the horse in the Marie Elena's cargo hold.</li>

<li>As well, if the player leaves and returns to the area the Ayleid Guardians' corpses are in after defeating them, they will no longer stand up as if "alive".</li>

<li>Imperial Legion Foresters should no longer fight with town guards.</li>
<li>Southern Books (Leyawiin) will no longer be a "red-door" trespass area while it is open for business, and will be properly locked up at night by Bugak Gro-Bol.</li>
<li>Locked door (requires key) in Unmarked Cave will now be unlocked, opening up three large explorable areas; there is no quest associated with this location, so no reason for the door to be locked, and there is no key that would open it (note that the player may need a high acrobatics skill to jump across the water in one section to access all of this cave).</li>
<li>Also corrected a twitchy tree root in Unmarked Cave just beyond the locked door.</li>
<li>Trevaia (Anvil Chapel of Dibella) will now offer restoration spells for sale as she was supposed to while in the chapel nave as other priests do (she was also set to sell potions, but had no potions to sell, so this has been removed).</li>
<li>Four merchants (Calindil of the Mystic Emporium and Edgar Vautrine of Edgar's Discount Spells in the Imperial City Market District, Ernest Manis of the Foaming Flask in the Imperial City Talos Plaza, and Ungarion of A Warlock's Luck in Bravil) will now have their previously missing option to invest in their shop for an Expert in Mercantile player.</li>

<li>Shamada, Ra'Jahirr and Julitta Plotius (Leyawiin) will no longer each futilely try to open a locked cupboard in Best Goods & Guarantees for two hours a day.</li>

<li>Gilgondorin (Silverhome-On-The-Water, Bravil) will no longer mention that the player should talk to Dro'shanji as he's seen strange creatures around his house (quest was never developed beyond this hint, being replaced with the unrelated Through A Nightmare, Darkly).</li>
<li>Khajiit will no longer use the greeting "To greet you? Or eat you?" to other Khajiit (including the player) nor Argonians the greetings "The prey approaches." or "Fresh game." to other Argonians.</li>
