<p style="text-align:center" class="m"><b style="font-size:32px">Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch: Version History</b>
<br>By <b>Quarn</b>, <b>Kivan</b>, <b>Arthmoor</b>, and <b>PrinceShroob</b></p>

<p class="h">v1.5.7 (2015-Aug-02) - Minor Update</p>
<ul>
<li>SEAmberMagicGreaves4 was incorrectly using an enchantment for the amber cuirass.</li>
<li>Corrected several houses across the Isles and the Mania and Dementia gardens using the “default” music type rather than the correct “public” music type.</li>
<li>Corrected two beer bottles in Dreamwalk Camp that could be nudged into the adjoining cell by the Heretics there and cause the land under the camp to disappear (refs 0004FDD2 and 0004FDAC).</li>
<li>Corrected an audio flub in one of Herdir’s lines (Sound\Voice\Oblivion.esm\Imperial\M\SE05_SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask_00083F4F_1.mp3 and Sound\Voice\Oblivion.esm\Imperial\M\SE05_SE05HerdirInvestigateCurrentTask_00083F4F_1.lip).</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v1.5.6 (2015-Jan-31) - Minor Update</p>
<ul>
<li>Thadon and Syl can no longer use the Order Priest’s combat taunts in SE12 – not only was it blocking their unique taunts for that moment, but Syl had no audio recorded.</li>
<li>Many elf male creature responses did not match the subtitles – they appeared to be speaking the line above it (High Elf/M/SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C5A_1.mp3, SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C5A_1.lip, SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C54_1.mp3, SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C54_1.lip, SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C55_1.mp3, SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C55_1.lip, SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C56_1.mp3, SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C56_1.lip, SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C57_1.mp3, SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C57_1.lip, SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C58_1.mp3, SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C58_1.lip, SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C59_1.mp3, and SEConversations_SECreatureResponses_00077C59_1.lip).</li>
<li>Restored Halion’s rumor about Sickly Bernice’s Taphouse; although the vanilla audio was only half the written line, completely correct audio was uncovered while completing the above fix, and so the Unofficial Patch will no longer prevent it from being said (High Elf/M/SEConversations_INFOGENERAL_0008E146_1.mp3 and SEConversations_INFOGENERAL_0008E146_1.lip).</li>
<li>AI pack SENanetteDonXaselmWander needed to be corrected since it was targeting "in cell" instead of a proper marker.</li>
<li>After being made a skill book in UOP 3.0.0, Children of the Sky was never added to SE39LLAllSkillBooks with the other skill books.</li>
<li>SE03GrommoksJournal: "3 Rain's Hand 3E431" / "12 Rain's Hand 3E431" / "13 Rain's Hand 3E431" / "14-16 Rain's Hand 3E431" / "17-19 Rain's Hand 3E431" ["3E431" -> "3E 431"]</li>
<li>SE09RelmynaLog3: "Subject 1 lasted less that a minute." ["less that" -> "less than"]</li>
<li>SEBookFallofVitharn: "He was seen in pubic only when organizing his vassal Fanatics for yet another raid on the countryside." ["in pubic" -> "in public"] / "The increasingly ill Count chose a vibrant peasant women as his betrothed, from a Heretic Commune in the wilds of Mania." ["peasant women" -> "peasant woman]</li>
<li>SEBookFromFrogToMan: "Kraften Highbrow maintains that they are cunning craftsman that make jewelry and weapons, even mining ore." ["craftsman" -> "craftsmen"]</li>
<li>SEBookGuidetoNewSheoth: "Cutter's Weapons, Bliss." ["Bliss" -> "Crucible"] / "The Missing Pauldron, Crucible." ["Crucible" -> "Bliss"] / "Owner Abhuki has scoured the realm in search of the most intriguing and varied assortment of magical items to be found almost anywhere." ["Abhuki" -> "Ahjazda"]</li>
<li>SEBookTheMadnessOfPelagius: "As king of Solitude, Pelagius' eccentricities of behavior began to be noticeable." ["king" -> "King"] / "so the attention of Tamriel focused on Sentinel." ["Sentinel" -> "Solitude"] / "There are many legends about his acts as King of Sentinel," ["Sentinel" -> "Solitude"]</li>
<li>SEBookSixteenAccordsofMadnessV9: "He challenged the Gods themselves, as well as the infantile public and corrupt state for worshiping them." ["worshiping" -> "worshipping"]</li>
<li>SEBookSixteenAccordsofMadnessV12: "Malacath began to stand, but kneeled again," ["kneeled" -> "knelt"]</li>
<li>Corrected Raven-Biter's name being rendered as anything other than "Raven-Biter" (with hyphen, two words).</li>
<li>Corrected Sheer-Meedish's NPC name to include the hyphen.</li>
<li>Removed the hyphen from all instances of "Big-Head" (while normally Cyrodiilic names for Argonians are hyphenated, Big Head appeared in Morrowind, where his name was consistently rendered without the hyphen).</li>
<li>Corrected the bed and door ownerships in Sickly Bernice's Taphouse and the Choosy Beggar so that no beds are free to sleep in and picking all the locked doors is a crime.</li>
<li>Corrected several of Relmyna Verenim's SE09 hellos, where erroneous "OR" conditioned could cause certain lines to appear prematurely if she was speaking to the player.</li>
<li>Corrected one of Ra'quanar's responses to the "Ciirta" topic to no longer be valid once she died, as it was blocking the line below it.</li>
<li>Corrected the subtitle of one of Haskill's lines when he stands in for his mater during DASheogorath ("Sire" was not included though it was spoken).</li>
<li>Though Kithlan promises to handle the matter and the journal reports that Brithaur has been thrown in jail for his crimes, Brithaur continued his usual routine if this path was chosen. He will no be relocated to the cells in the House of Dementia.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v1.5.5 (2014-Aug-31) - Minor Update</p>
<ul>
<li>NPCs fighting Knights of Order will no longer use the combat taunts for fighting Imperials or Elves – technically, Knights of Order are Imperials and High Elves in unplayable armor with different attack and hit lines, but lore-wise they certainly aren’t.</li>
<li>Corrected Golden Saints and Dark Seducers still using their default goodbyes when the played had completed SE13.</li>
<li>Corrected a variety of quest-related hellos and goodbyes being flagged as random or being said to NPCs other than the player.</li>
<li>At the start of SE08, when Sheogorath teleports out of the Sanctum, he will no longer use his default goodbye, which was always cut off. He will instead use a relevant SE07 goodbye that’s much shorter.</li>
<li>Corrected a number of Golden Saint and Dark Seducer hellos lacking the “random end” flag, which allowed them to bleed into their default hellos if the player was male.</li>
<li>Wide-Eye had a response to asking about Thadon in SE04 that was being blocked by her other response.</li>
<li>Sheogorath can understand Bolwing, so during “Falling Awake,” Bolwing will speak coherently about “Sleep outside” if either the player has Big-Head’s charm, or is Sheogorath.</li>
<li>Fixed Sheogorath trying to idle with his non-existent cane at the start of SE11.</li>
<li>Transformed Heretic bosses were SEHereticMelee by class rather than SEHereticMage like every single other Heretic.</li>
<li>Applied UOP publican fix to Sickly Bernice and Raven-Biter.</li>
<li>Wide-Eye had a greeting for female players in which she called them “my lord”; this has been corrected to “my lady.”</li>
<li>Corrected the audio for one of Halion’s rumors to speak about a man in Bliss rather than Crucible, as this rumor refers to Amiable Fanriene, who lives in the Manic section of the city.</li>
<li>The corrected audio for Dyus was missing a .lip file.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v1.5.4 (2014-Jun-30) - Minor Update</p>
<ul>
<li>Distribution Note: The EXE installer is no longer supported and will not be distributed to hosting sites from this point forward.</li>
<li>The USIP will now have the UOP linked as an explicit master file so that it will sort better when used with <a href="http://loot.github.io/">LOOT</a>.</li>
<li>The COBL GenericLoreScript has been synchronized with the official COBL 1.73 update.</li>
<li>When approaching Pinnacle Rock, Adeo is supposed to have a topic to tell you about Dylora but it is never added to the available topics list.</li>
<li>During The Helpless Army (SE10) Dylora is supposed to have a scripted death event that does not work because her script failed to remove QuestObject status first.</li>
<li>Even though a magic Amber Sword should only take 3 pieces of amber, the dialogue conditions were requiring 4 due to checking the wrong global variable.</li>
<li>During The Coming Storm (SE44) if the player was wearing the Calming Pants before speaking to Ahjazda, the spell would not be removed from the player.</li>
<li>Moved a pair of monster spawners that were dangerously close to Split and could end up killing off the residents before the player knew there was a quest there.</li>
<li>Runs-in-Circles would continue to shout "Nininininini" even after being dead due to her script not shutting down the timers properly.</li>
<li>In Symbols of Office (SE11) Dyus mentions the "Howling Halls of Mania" - they're in Dementia. The line has been cut to remove mention of Mania.</li>
<li>Tove the Unrestful was not a member of the Choosy Beggar faction and so could not run two of his eat packages.</li>
<li>If Ushnar gro-Shadborgob is killed before collecting the reward in Ushnar's Terror (SE43) the quest will be terminated as a failure as with other quests whose quest givers can be killed.</li>
<li>During The Liturgy of Vision (SE11a) if you declare that you are going to kill Ra'kheran he does not start combat with the player.</li>
<li>AI packs ArenaFan1GreetPlayer and ArenaFan1FollowPlayer have been fixed so the Adoring Fan will not pursue the player into the Shivering Isles.</li>
<li>Stealing oddity items from the museum does not result in crime detection due to the script attached to the items.</li>
<li>Muurine would not be killed by the spell during The Lady of Paranoia (SE05) because the game never removes her essential status before trying to kill her.</li>
<li>Relan did not have a list of spells to use despite being a mage.</li>
<li>Atrabhi (both Mania and Dementia versions) did not have a list of spells despite being a mage.</li>
<li>NPCs could use combat taunts intended for Imperials when fighting with Knights of Order.</li>
<li>SE08PriestOfOrder01 had an enable parent but shouldn't have since this prevents the scripts in the game from correctly toggling the enable status.</li>
<li>Corrected one of Una Armina's greetings in the incorrect order, which would cause SE38 to not advance to stage 10 if the first time you spoke to her was in the Museum of Oddities.
<li>Corrected Sheer-Meedish's SENQDGeneric greeting for the player as Sheogorath having the "random end" flag checked, effectively limiting her to two greetings once Shivering Isles' main quest was completed.</li>
<li>Corrected Nanette Don's introductory greeting having the "random" flag set.</li>
<li>Relmyna Verenim was coming across as more insane than she should have due to conflict between her greetings, hellos, and goodbyes in SEConversations and her hellos and goodbyes in SE09Misc -- she was almost uniformly nasty in most of her dialogue, but her SE09Misc dialogue could be almost flirty if her disposition was high enough. To solve this, her SE09Misc dialogue will now only occur once "Rebuilding the Gatekeeper" is completed, and a new greeting has been made for her by repurposing a disposition-specific greeting from SE09: if she likes you enough at the end of the quest, she will be welcoming and will be her usual crabby self otherwise. In addition, corrected her player-as-Sheogorath hellos were being blocked by her SE09Misc dialogue, and she will no longer use her SE09Misc dialogue in conversation with other NPCs.</li>
<li>Thaedil's "Did you see my last performance?..." hello was meant to link in NPC conversations to a response where the NPC either compliments or insults her abilities, but the hello was also trying to link to generic conversation topics that are disabled when in the Shivering Isles. In addition, the juggling response itself will link to goodbyes rather than also trying to link to generic responses.</li>
<li>Generic hellos and goodbyes were meant to not be spoken by anyone other than NPCs in the Mania, Dementia, or Wilderness factions, but due to a misplaced "OR" in the conditions, any NPC of a playable race could use them. This will curtail very short discussions between NPCs like Zealots.</li>
<li>Due to a quirk in the random flag settings, certain NPCs' hello dialogues meant for the player once they were Sheogorath could almost never be heard; they will now be random like other such hellos.</li>
<li>Corrected a few NPCs' Sheogorath hellos being below the generic dialogue, resulting in them never being said.</li>
<li>Bolwing will no longer use New Sheoth residents' hellos for when the player is burning with the Flame of Agnon or when the player has lit the Torch, and he will also not talk about Greenmote while "Ritual of Mania" is running.</li>
<li>Fixed various Shivering Isles NPCs' hellos or goodbyes not linking to or from the proper responses.</li>
<li>Pyke's hello after his quest could be spoken to any NPC, not just the player, blocking his unique conversations with his girlfriend.</li>
<li>Uungor had a sleep package that was set to the incorrect package type.</li>
<li>Sheer-Meedish had two AI packages that were set as "find" rather than "wander."</li>
<li>Cindanwe's packages to supervise her workers were not set up properly.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v1.5.3 (2013-Dec-31) - Minor Update</p>
<ul>
<li>0005965a: Bed should be owned by SEHaleFaction so that both NPCs in the house can use it.</li>
<li>SEDisElytaHatchling, SEDisScalon1, SEDisScalon2, and SEDisScalon3 were not set to manual zero cost "spells" and could therefore be resisted as magic unlike all other diseases in the game.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v1.5.2 (2012-Dec-31) - Minor Update</p>
<ul>
<li>The enchantment progression on the Order swords was still not correct after having fixed the leveled list.</li>
<li>SE07SacellumAltarBlessing, SE14GreatTorchDementiaSpell, and SE14GreatTorchManiaSpell needed to be set as powers to avoid having their effects stripped by mundane dispels.</li>
<li>Script SE14ProtectionScript made a call to the MoveTo function prematurely which caused the script to abort before it was entirely complete.</li>
<li>Facegen texture data had been generated for the vanilla game, but Bethesda never generated the files for Shivering Isles. This data is now included with the new DLCShiveringIsles - Faces.bsa file. Theoretically, these files help with game performance.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v1.5.1 (2012-Jul-25) - Minor Update</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the RufioDie_Script having a stray endif that prevented the script from compiling. As well as the invalid underscore.</li>
<li>Cutter's upstairs bedroom door was not owned by her, and had no key assigned, so her fixed AI was trapping her upstairs instead.</li>
<li>Several minor edits to path grids to correct floating nodes, isolated nodes, and nodes buried under objects.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v1.5.0 (2011-Nov-12)</p>
<b>USIP Changes/Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>As was done with the UOP, integrated the COBL common menuing system (on first load you'll have a weightless "Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch" misc. item with a key icon added, which isn't a quest item so you can drop if you don't want it, so there are now three ways to open the USIP menu: <b>startquest usip</b> in the console, equip the item, or if you have COBL active it will go into the common menu)</li>
<li>Moved the following USIPS changes into a separate ESP ( USIPS Additional Changes.esp ) so that they are still available at player discretion:
 <ul>
  <li>Addition of Battle Axe of Diminishing and Dagger of Diminishing to leveled list SELL0LootWeapon0Magic2Steel100</li>
  <li>Addition of War Axe of Sapping and Warhammer of Sapping to leveled list SELL0LootWeapon0Magic3Silver100</li>
  <li>Addition of Battle Axe of Enfeeblement to leveled list SELL0LootWeapon0Magic4Dwarven100</li>
  <li>Addition of Dagger of Weakness, Battle Axe of Weakness, and Immolator (fire damage elven claymore) to leveled list SELL0LootWeapon0Magic5Elven100</li>
  <li>Addition of War Axe of Beguilement to leveled list SELL0LootWeapon0Magic6Glass100</li>
  <li>Addition of Tempest (shock-damage ebony claymore) to leveled list SELL0LootWeapon0Magic7Ebony100</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The player's bounty can now be properly cleared after the Main Quest as was intended if it is 5,000 septims or higher</li>

</ul>

<b>NPC/Quest/Scripting Fixes</b>

<li>Dredhwen (The Wastrel's Purse, Passwall) will no longer be missing from there for no reason after the main quest is completed</li>

<li>Post-main-quest Defense of the Realm enemies will now only be generated from leveled lists to avoid save bloating</li>
<li>Overrode the UOP's changes to the Sheogorath shrine quest in Tamriel so the changes introduced by Shivering Isles aren't reverted</li>
<li>In the quest The Great Divide, killing Jastira Nanus on the Dementia side of Split will now properly advance the quest (was checking an incorrect NPC's death)</li>
<li>Fixed conditions on one of the responses to Mirili Ulven in the Taxonomy of Obsession quest when she asks if the player has found a creature</li>
<li>Updated the Baiting the Mousetrap quest's reward fix so that it is more accurate</li>
<li>Updated the fix for Sheogorath's disappearing cane so that it is more effective</li>
<li>Wearing an Apostle Robe in Howling Halls in the Symbols of Office quest will now properly work as a disguise allowing the player to talk to Apostles</li>
<li>The Staff of Sheogorath presented by Dyus in the Symbols of Office will no longer continue to hover in place even after the player has activated it and transferred it to their inventory</li>
<li>In the quest The Roots of Madness, speaking to Haskill before trying the Font of Madness will now properly advance the quest</li>

<li>Some missed items will now revert properly to player ownership in the Ritual of Mania quest after Thadon is dead</li>
<li>In the Ghosts of Vitharn quest, "The curse is not lifted." will no longer be added as a dialog topic (it's only a response branch)</li>
<li>Also in Ghosts of Vitharn, Count Cirion's goodbye at quest conclusion will now end dialog properly if the player has completed the Main Quest</li>
<li>The New Sheoth smiths Cutter and Dumag gro-Bonk will no longer erroneously offer recharging; instead Earil (Crucible) will as he should have</li>

<li>Ranarr-Jo will now properly follow Cindanwe around on Loredas and Sundas as he was intended to</li>

<li>The Dark Seducer Dylora (Pinnacle Rock) will now have Dark Seducer dialog (was missing from the faction)</li>
<li>Missing dialog from Haskill during the Ritual of Dementia quest will now appear (it was under the wrong branch of the dialog tree)</li>
<li>Eight greetings from various male Nord and Orc NPCs, seven from various female Argonian and Khajiit NPCs, six from various female and two from male Imperial NPCs, five from various female elven NPCs, two from male Redguard NPCs, one from Amiable Fanriene, Bolwing, the Dark Seducers at Pinnacle Rock and the Golden Saints at Brellach, when the player has completed the Main Quest will now appear; were unlinked or being blocked by other greetings</li>
<li>Four other pieces of dialog from Bolwing when the player has completed the Main Quest will now appear (they are special as Sheogorath can understand him)</li>
<li>Cutter and Ushnar gro-Shadborgob (Crucible) and Big Head (Bliss) will now sleep properly; couldn't due to incorrect AI</li>
<li>Felas Sarandas (Passwall) will now sleep properly; couldn't as Nanette Don had ownership of both beds at his location</li>
<li>Cutter will no longer end up with thousands of sparring weapons due to scripting oversight (as was done with other affected NPCs)</li>
<li>Knights of Order will properly carry the less powerful Simple Order Swords at levels 6-8 and the more powerful Primal Order Swords at levels 9-11, instead of the reverse due to a leveled list error</li>
<li>Fixed the change to Heretics preventing the "no greeting" bug so that they can be pickpocketed, as was done with Zealots</li>
<li>The Dark Seducer faction rank of Autkendo Jansa, Dark Seducer Grakedrig, Dark Seducer Kiskedrig and Grakendo Udico was corrected to match their names (note that there are similar Golden Saints, but their names do not match existing faction ranks)</li>
</ul>

<b>Creature Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Verdant Gnarls will no longer appear at player level 9 rather than 19 due to a leveled list error</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Fork of Horripilation now has its proper inventory icon and reach value, and will not remain a quest item indefinitely</li>
<li>Dark Seducer arrows will now have the correct icon, rather than that of Golden Saints' arrows</li>
<li>The Sterile, Primal, Pure, Immaculate and Perfect Order Swords are no longer missing their enchantments</li>

<li>Tied Kiliban's Key (carried by Kiliban Nyrandil) to all non-quest locked loot containers in Xedilian as it also wasn't being used for anything</li>
</ul>

<b>Text Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected the name of Caldana Monrius' key: "Monirus" » "Monrius"</li>
<li>Corrected staff name: "Syndel's Boltcaster" » "Syndelius' Boltcaster"</li>
<li>Corrected weapon names: "Worn Dark Waraxe", "Worn Golden Waraxe": "Waraxe" » "War Axe" which matches the Oblivion naming convention</li>
<li>Corrected weapon names of 36 Amber and Madness swords and war axes changing "Sword" » "Longsword" and "Axe" » "War Axe" which matches the Oblivion naming convention</li>
<li>Corrected weapon name "Grand Mad~ness Longsword" removing the "~" which is an unneeded line break</li>
<li>Changed the item names "Amber Sword Matrix" and "Madness Sword Matrix": "Sword" » "Longsword" to match the weapon names</li>
<li>Corrected typo in Amiable Fanrien dialog SE40_SE40GreetingChoice2_000790C0_2: "I'm seen" » "I've seen"</li>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>

<li>Corrected audio in Grakendo Udico reply dialog SE08_SE08PlaceGuardsYes_00017D86_1 where she calls the player "my Lord" rather than "Your Grace" (as the player is still the Duke/Duchess; the subtitle reflects this)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v1.4.0 (2008-Aug-26)</p>
<b>USIP Changes/Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>As was done with the UOP, reoptimized 206 of the 231 NIF meshes already in the USIP to eliminate possible FPS hit on some of them that seems to have been introduced by the old PyFFI NIFOptimize spell; the new one shapifies strip blocks if the average strip length is less than 10 and eliminates the problem; many of the meshes (also due to much manual optimization) now provide better FPS than the stock ones</li>
<li>Added Wrye Bash tags to the USIP ESP so fixes to stats., inventory, etc. can be preserved by building a Bashed Patch</li>
<li>Fixed the USIP mesh for Muurine's house (Crucible) upstairs DementiaHouse04InteriorTop.NIF not appearing as the file was in the wrong path</li>
<li>Fixed the change to Zealots preventing the "no greeting" bug so that they can be pickpocketed</li>
</ul>

<b>NPC/Quest/Scripting Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Dredhwen (Wastrel's Purse, Passwall) having no barter dialog whatsoever</li>
<li>Corrected oversight where the Sheogorath-Shaped Amber required for the Museum of Oddities quest could only randomly appear in non-respawning amber limbs/stumps so it was possible to never be able to find one; it will now be possible to find on Elder Gnarls (which respawn)</li>
<li>Dylora should no longer follow the player (even into Cyrodiil) after the Helpless Army quest is completed (will also fix affected saves)</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the map marker for the door to Cyrodiil in the Ordered Fringe having an Ayleid Ruin icon, whereas in the unordered Fringe it was a landmark icon</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v1.3.0 (2008-July-3)</p>
<b>USIP Changes/Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Removed all 1,191 deletions of objects (ie underground rocks) to eliminate any chance that the USIP causes crash-on-exit as this has been confirmed to be a cause (if a mod loaded later changes an object an earlier loaded one deleted) and replaced them with object disables/moves where appropriate</li>
<li>Restored the missing Passwall map marker</li>
<li>Fixed the self-installer not adding the fixed texture (there's only one required for Sheogorath's beard) to ArchiveInvalidation.txt and added an option for ArchiveInvalidation so that it can be unchecked and skipped if the player is using an ArchiveInvalidation replacer mod/method</li>
</ul>

<b>NPC/Quest/Scripting Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed severe bug with Sheogorath sometimes being completely missing when the player returns to the palace after the Retaking the Fringe quest (will also fix existing saves)</li>
<li>Fixed severe but uncommon bug with the Ritual of Mania quest (and possibly the Ritual of Dementia with Thadon as well) where Syl would not appear in the Sacellum when the Ritual was completed, leaving the player stuck in cutscene mode</li>
<li>Fixed severe timer bug with the Lady of Paranoia quest where if the player was discovered when listening to Ma'zaddha and Nelrene, they would never talk again in future meetings, preventing the main quest from advancing</li>
<li>Fixed bug with the staging of the Museum of Oddities quest where if the player stole one of the original three Oddities (Ring of Desiccation, the most noticed as it's a quest item that needs to be stolen for The Coming Storm; also the Gatekeeper Arm and Pygmy Skull) and then asked for a tour, they could no longer return the item to Una Armina, and if she had just been returned the item, she would never place it (will also fix existing saves)</li>
<li>The Crucible "Fight Club" NPC's (Muurine confirmed, and possibly also Caldana Monrius, Ma'zaddha and Ushnar gro-Shadborgob) should no longer occasionally have thousands of sparring weapons in their inventories</li>
<li>Corrected oversight of the player not being able to invest in any merchants' shops in the Shivering Isles if their Mercantile skill is 75 (Expert) or higher, as they can do in Cyrodiil (investing in Raven Biter of the Choosy Beggar, Bliss, will make him into a usable fence in the Isles as his available gold will go from 3 to 503)</li>
<li>Fixed Sheogorath being immobile, unable to send the player to Execution Point if the player knocked him down (Paralyze spell, power attack, etc.) leaving the game stuck with the player's controls disabled</li>
<li>Fixed Priests of Order at obelisks having too many Hearts Of Order (sometimes over ten; supposed to have two) as they would get more every time they were resurrected by the obelisk</li>
<li>Fixed Felas Sarandas (the Passwall traitor) sometimes not attacking the Gatekeeper at the end of the Rebuilding the Gatekeeper quest, so could be found standing around in Passwall in a Priest of Order's robe, ignored by the Saints/Seducers there</li>
<li>Fixed the Gates of Madness so that they only autosave on first use at the end of Through The Fringe of Madness, instead of every time the player goes through them (as well as being unnecessary the autosave would occasionally cause a crash to desktop)</li>
<li>Corrected the reward paid at the end of the Great Divide quest as it could be as little as half of what it should have been</li>
<li>Fixed the Aquanostrum shrine in Knotty Bramble, Hatchery giving the player a full Aquanostrum flask even if the player didn't have an empty one, thus would have a quest item stuck in inventory (will also fix existing saves)</li>
<li>Corrected minor oversight in the Ghosts of Vitharn quest with the brazier where it would still give a message that it was "seeking something" after Desideratus' doll was burned</li>
<li>Fixed Traelius giving the "I HAVE NO GREETING" response if spoken to (usually he attacks the player but there are ways of preventing this)</li>
<li>Jayred Ice-Veins will no longer remain essential for the rest of the game after Through The Fringe of Madness if the Bone Arrows aren't collected from him</li>
<li>Added the cell check fixes present in the UOP so that Lucien Lachance won't appear in Henantier's Dreamworld and break the quest (same script is present in the USIP so overrides the UOP one)</li>
<li>Made a line of dialog from Halion (Hale) about Sickly Bernice so that it will no longer appear (was missing half of its audio; no good replacement audio available)</li>
<li>Corrected conditions on an Ordered Fringe Saint/Seducer greeting that said Sheogorath had vanished before he had</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a Crucible load screen missing conditions, so would appear outside the Shivering Isles</li>
<li>Corrected inconsistent durations of the Summon Golden Saint and Summon Dark Seducer powers obtained after the Rituals to be become Duke/Duchess and after The Helpless Army (the version of the side that the player chose and was the Duke/Duchess of had a duration of 60 seconds, but the other was inexplicably 120 seconds; made them all 120 seconds)</li>
<li>Cleared the ownership of Hirrus Clutumnus' (non-respawning) cupboard in/after the Final Resting quest so that items the player stores in it don't occasionally get flagged as stolen</li>
<li>Integrated the cell change in Quarn's nVidia Black Screen Fix into the USIP so the separate plugin is no longer required (note that if mods change Shivering Isles interior cells they may override the change. All that is required for modders to prevent this is that on an interior with Fog values Near, Far and Clip Dist. all zero, to set Near to 0.0001; Wrye Bash's "Fog Fix" function will set the appropriate values in any ESP automatically)</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crashing to desktop or freezing requiring terminating Oblivion.exe if the player equipped the Ring of Disrobing while wearing Count Cirion's Helmet in the Ghosts of Vitharn quest</li>
<li>Also corrected that if the player cast Bound Helmet that Count Cirion's Helmet would be removed and could be dropped though it was supposed to be "cursed" and undroppable</li>
<li>Fixed both versions of female Scruffy Shoes looking like ankle bracelets (both worn and ground)</li>
<li>Fixed the Weakness to Shock effect of all versions of Nerveshatter (Syl's hammer) not working because the duration was zero</li>
<li>Undid dirty change to stock enchantment EnWeapShockDamage15Lightning which changed several non-SI weapons adding a Soul Trap effect (appears that it was used as a test for the new SI "Soul" weapons but none of them use it; new enchantments had been made for them)</li>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Added "excessive ambient fix" enable parents to the Aichan Prison, Blackroot Lair and Fain as they had an excess of ambient sound objects</li>
</ul>

<b>Text Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Changed the name of the harvestable flora that produces the Blind Watcher's Eye ingredient: "Watcher's Eye" » "Blind Watcher's Eye" so it can be identified (as is already the case with the Mute Screaming Maw)</li>
<li>Changed the name of the Two-Headed Septim: "Coin" » "Septim" (which matches the static one)</li>
<li>Fixed typo in Grommok's Journal (SE03GrommoksJournal) "3E341" » "3E431" (two instances)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v1.1.0 (2007-December-19)</p>
<b>USIP Changes</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated the USIP installer to Inno Setup v5.2.2</li>
<li>The USIP now has a menu. To access it, open the console with ` or ~ or whatever key is used in your locale, type <b>startquest usip</b> (not case sensitive) and press Enter, then close the console (may take five seconds to appear the first time, but instantaneous after this.) It will allow you to see that the USIP is active and the version number and toggle two of the fixes below on or off</li>
<li>Corrected v1.0 fix for the Howling Halls Apostles' "no greeting" bug as it was preventing them from being looted for the quest's optional path's Apostle Dagger items</li>
<li>Corrected v1.0 fix for Mirili Ulven's Taxonomy of Obsession quest dialog as it was causing the Mirili's Bestiary topic to never appear if the player gave her all of the items on her list at once, which broke the quest</li>
</ul>

<b>NPC/Quest/Scripting Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the script check for the Vitharn's Mausoleum brazier in the Ghosts of Vitharn quest which was allowing the player to burn Desideratus' doll without having it or even knowing what it was, which caused the final Fanatic to never appear at quest end and thus broke the quest</li>
<li>Ahjazda should no longer fall off the walkway to Things Found (Crucible) and die, breaking The Coming Storm quest</li>
<li>Fixed the Through the Fringe of Madness quest stalling with the Gatekeeper and adventurers standing around doing nothing if the player left the Isles before this stage and leveled up</li>
<li>In the Coming Storm quest, fixed the confusing torches around the Diligence Crux urn holding the Amulet of Disintegration; they were missing their enable parents so were always lit which made it appear that something was wrong or confused the player about lighting the braziers </li>
<li>Fixed all Grummites with bows carrying iron bows instead of their own Grummite bows (which were completely unused)</li>
<li>The player will no longer receive an assault bounty for fighting Syl in the Roots of Madness quest, nor an assault bounty and/or murder stat. increase in the Ritual of Dementia quest</li>
<li>Having a bounty and talking to any guards during The End of Order quest will no longer get the player ejected from the Palace and unable to get back in to finish the battle or force them to fight their allies; cleared any bounty at quest beginning as it is already being cleared at the end anyway</li>
<li>Fixed the Dark Seducer Escort reward from the main quest missing the dismiss option in her dialog as the Golden Saint has</li>
<li>Fixed dialog bug where dismissing one of the two Escorts, or even just talking to an idle one and declining an escort, would dismiss both of them</li>
<li>Fixed both Escorts not fast-traveling to follow the player; it appears that all companion fast-travel was disabled in the Shivering Isles as normal companions will not fast-travel if PlayerInSEWorld is set to 1. As this fix uses game-mode scripting to keep the Escorts close to the player (thus they may pop into view in third-person mode if they get too far behind) it is off by default and can be toggled on or off with the menu (see above)</li>
<li>Corrected oversight of areas of the Palace being trespass zones after completion of the Main Quest; fixed NPC behavior and cell/item ownership so that the player will not get attacked or arrested anywhere in the Palace (note that owned beds will remain so, also did not open the Greenmote Silo if the player replaced Syl nor the Xirethard entrance if the player replaced Thadon as these are secret areas which the player would not know existed without having done the quests)</li>
<li>Fixed Jyggalag's sword not appearing on its pedestal behind Sheogorath's Throne after The End of Order quest unless the player left and re-entered the cell, or at all for some players; replaced with an activator and static mesh USIPSE13JygglalagClaymoreStatic.nif which will give the player the correctly leveled sword when activated</li>
<li>Pinnacle Rock (if the player replaced Thadon) and Brellach (if the player replaced Syl) will no longer respawn Knights and Priests of Order and be strewn with dead Seducer or Saint bodies after the main quest is completed</li>
<li>Corrected oversight of conflict between the Prince of Madness (post-Main Quest) and Great Divide quests where if any resident of Split died in random attacks the player would get a quest advancement that they did it and could not finish the quest; Split will no longer come up as a random attack area if the Great Divide quest is not completed</li>
<li>Fixed being able to choose the "Defend the Realm" topic right away after being told by Haskill all was peaceful and find there was an attack; will now take thirty seconds (real time) for another 50% chance of a random attack to appear after most recent selection of the topic</li>
<li>Corrected oversight at the start of the Symbols of Office quest of the player being able to talk to Sheogorath during his transformation, including after his disappearance (he would repeat his previous monologue)</li>
<li>Fixed the player not obtaining Shadowrend from their clone in the Symbols of Office quest if the player had bound weapon spells; they were not being removed from the clone so it could cast them and thus unequip Shadowrend into its inaccessible inventory</li>
<li>Also fixed the clone not having enough torches removed from its inventory so it would sometimes equip a torch while fighting the player</li>
<li>In The Lady of Paranoia quest, fixed Ma'zaddha's evidence cupboard being already unlocked even though Ma'zaddha carries a quest-required key for it, and added a note to the journal that this cupboard is safe storage, as there is no documented safe storage container in the Shivering Isles (ie no buyable or awarded homes) until several stages later in the main quest</li>
<li>In the Taxonomy of Obsession quest, Mirili Ulven should no longer kill the creatures that the player brings for her instead of paralyzing them and rewarding the player</li>
<li>Other Highcross residents (Bruscus Dannus and Runs-in-Circles) should no longer attack commanded Scalons that the player is bringing for Mirili Ulven</li>
<li>The player will no longer get a quest termination update from the Taxonomy of Obsession quest if Mirili Ulven dies after the quest is completed</li>
<li>Ma'zaddha's corpse will no longer persist indefinitely in his house after the Lady of Paranoia quest is complete</li>
<li>Corrected Anya Herrick's response to the Conspiracy topic of the Lady of Paranoia quest reverting to knowing nothing about a conspiracy after she has already admitted to it</li>
<li>The Final Resting quest will no longer permanently stall if Hirrus Clutumnus' request is initially refused</li>
<li>Fixed Hirrus Clutumnus' terrified cowering starting immediately after the player agrees to help him</li>
<li>Added a safe storage note to the Final Resting journal entry on quest completion (see above) as both containers in Hirrus' house are safe</li>
<li>Hirrus Clutumnus' corpse will no longer persist indefinitely</li>
<li>Corrected oversight of the Ghosts of Suicide Hill dying if pushed off of the cliff by the player (was clearly erroneous as if activated when dead the message that they could not be talked to still appeared)</li>
<li>The corpse of the fake Syl will no longer persist in the Duchess' Quarters after the Ritual of Dementia quest (it would disappear normally on cell reset, but this was unlikely to occur if the player was using the cell as a home)</li>
<li>Kithlan and Anya Herrick should no longer be attacked by Dark Seducer Royal Guards after the Ritual of Dementia quest due to helping the player fight them when they were hostile</li>
<li>In the Ritual of Dementia quest, corrected Arctus' (priest of Dementia) responding hostilely to being asked about Kithlan and Anya Herrick as if the player is an "agent of Dementia" when he is fully aware of what's happening</li>
<li>Thadon's meal and wine will no longer give a message that the player has no Greenmote if they are found before the quest has even started, and corrected the message for Thadon's wine already being drugged saying "food" instead of "wine"</li>
<li>Gundlar will no longer continue to deliver Thadon's food and wine (with functioning quest activators) after Thadon has defected in the Ritual of Dementia quest</li>
<li>Corrected oversights of the cell names "Duke's Quarters" remaining unchanged after the Ritual of Mania quest for a female player, and "Duchess' Quarters" after the Ritual of Dementia quest for a male player</li>
<li>Fixed the ownership of both Syl's and Thadon's thrones so that Syl's can't be sat on by the player before the Ritual of Dementia quest is completed, and Thadon's can be after the Ritual of Mania</li>
<li>Fixed the ownership of the Greenmote Silo so that the player is no longer trespassing in it once they have completed the Ritual of Mania quest and become the Duke/Duchess of Mania</li>
<li>The male Golden Saint and Dark Seducer reinforcements in the Helpless Army quest (only appear if the females die) should no longer follow the player after the quest is completed, even into Cyrodiil</li>
<li>After the Helpless Army quest, Dylora will no longer immediately leave the Wellspring area and wander back to her prison chamber for no apparent reason</li>
<li>Staada (Helpless Army quest Golden Saint commander) will no longer tell the player to inform Sheogorath of victory if spoken to after the main quest is completed</li>
<li>Changed the trophy chime activator in Sheogorath's Palace for the Helpless Army quest so that it rings like the chimes in Brellach and Pinnacle Rock</li>
<li>Fixed Sheogorath missing his cane, but still using the unique animations as if he had it, occasionally in the Sacellum and always at the start of the Symbols of Office quest</li>
<li>Corrected four NPC's (Dulphumph gro-Urgash, Dumag gro-Bonk, Erver Devani and Una Armina) using the wrong skeleton mesh (SkeletonBeast.NIF instead of Skeleton.NIF); did not cause any known problems but may as well fix it so that future clothing/armor replacer mods don't cause them to grow a tail</li>
<li>Changed Fimmion to have no Rumors topic as it was in the default elven voice which is quite different from his</li>
<li>Golden Saints will no longer call other Golden Saints or Dark Seducers "mortals" when dismissing their conversation</li>
<li>Dead Vitharn Ghost Fanatics will no longer give a message that they do not respond if the player tries to loot them (they disappear in less than a second anyways)</li>
<li>Fixed the secret walls in Ebrocca, Sepechra failing to open if the player revisited the cell after it reset</li>
<li>Ebrocca, Masse will no longer autosave every time the player passes through it if they've gone through two other cells in the interim, unless it has respawned and thus there is a reason for it</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The player will now receive the correctly leveled version of the Talisman of Abetment at the conclusion of the Baiting the Mousetrap quest, and the correctly leveled version of the Ring of Happiness at the conclusion of the Final Resting quest</li>
<li>The Keys to Dementia & Mania and Relmyna's Tears will no longer remain quest items stuck in the player's inventory when the Through the Fringe of Madness quest is completed</li>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed excessive ambient sound objects in Bliss, Crucible and many of the larger dungeons causing dropped voice and effect audio, distortion or other audio problems, or even crashes or lockups on load of interior cells, for players with older soundcards; this fix is off by default and can be toggled on or off with the menu (see above)</li>

<li>Set Big Head's responsibility to 50 so he doesn't go around stealing forks anymore (he will still take forks but only if they are un-owned) which would get him slaughtered by the guards/NPC's before the player could even get his quest or finish it.</li>
<li>Corrected typo in the names of 4 doors (SENSTheMissingPauldronSEManiaLCdoor01, SEDementiaSettlementDoor01, SEDementiaDoorInteriorAnim01, SEManiaLCdoor01), now known as "Wooden Door" not "Wooden door".</li>
<li>Fix a bug in a script (SE07ADarkSeducerEliteQuartersGuard01Script) that caused the 2 Dark Seducer Royal Guards in the Dementia Garden not to patrol properly (one wouldn't move at all and the other would walk back and forth not completing the full patrol loop).</li>
<li>All oddity items in the museum are now static and cannot be moved around and lost.</li>
<li>Fixed the missing alpha property on Sheogorath's beard (beard.nif); as a result had to fix the already existing alpha (his tongue would disappear) in the beard's texture (beard.dds); Sheogorath's beard now blends well and looks a lot nicer.</li>
<li>No longer possible to loot Jyggalag (he doesn't have anything anyway).</li>
<li>No longer possible to pick up a second copy of Cindanwe's book if you happened to finish the quest and kill her (any duplicate books you have will be removed if you've finished the quest).</li>
<li>Fixed 3 Dark Seducer Royal Guards who were wearing normal helmets, (SE07ADarkSeducerEliteChambersGuard01, SE07ADarkSeducerEliteChambersGuard02, SE07ADarkSeducerEliteQuartersGuard01) they already had the elite helmet in their inventory except their was a levelled list of the standard helmet in their as well so they worn it instead.</li>
<li>Fixed the holding position on the Amber longsword.</li>
<li>Fixed the Dark Mace icon; the full size version of the icon was missing and depending on your screen resolution you'd see no icon for it.
<li>Removed superfluous alpha properties from the male and female Dark Seducer armor and the dropped versions.</li>
<li>Fixed Una Armina not recognizing the 3 initial items in the museum upon first time.</li>
<li>Fixed bad UV mapping on the Dementia house (DementaiHouse07.NIF).</li>
