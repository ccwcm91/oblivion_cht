<p class="h"><a name="des">1. Description</a></p>
This mod is a joint effort to fix the vast amount of bugs currently existing in the Shivering Isles expansion pack for Oblivion v1.2.0416, fixing over 200 bugs so far! If you're experiencing a bug with Oblivion and it's not fixed by our mod please by all means report the bug to us in as much detail as possible so we can try fix it! Also if you find any: levitating trees or rocks, see-through or fall-through walls\objects or other stuff out of place, please let either of us know. To get the exact location, use the console commands <b>sdt 0</b> and then <b>tdt</b> please note the Cell (not PC Cell) and Pos values and indicate what's out of place. You can use <b>tdt</b> again to toggle the debug display off. Thank you and we hope you have a better Oblivion experience!

<br><br><b>Warning: Only use the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch with the version of Oblivion is was created for! Using it on an older or newer version then v1.2.0416 of Oblivion may cause bugs or things not to be fixed that were advertised as such!</b>

<ul>
<li>None currently known.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h"><a name="install">3. Installation (BAIN)</a></p>
<b>1.)</b> Copy the <b>Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch.7z</b> into the folder you use for BAIN installers. The default for this would be <b>Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion Mods\</b>.
<br><b>2.)</b> In the BAIN tab, make sure the USIP file is at the top of the package list, directly below the UOP. Right click on it, select "Move To" and use slot 1.
<br><b>3.)</b> Left click on the file after it's moved. Then right click on the file and select "Install".
<br><b>4.)</b> Once installed, enable the .esp file via the Mods tab. It is recommended to run BOSS at this point to verify load order placement.
<br><b>5.)</b> Make sure you've got some form of archive invalidation set. You can use Wrye Bash, OBMM, or the <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/10724">ArchiveInvalidation Invalidated!</a> for this.
<br><br>If you are updating the USIP from an older version, after making sure Step 2 is done, you can right click the file and select "Anneal" and it will update the files accordingly while also preserving anything later in your setup that needs to override them.

<p class="h"><a name="installM">4. Installation (Manual Version)</a></p>
<b>1.)</b> Extract <b>Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch.7z</b> into your <b>Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion\Data\</b> folder.
<br><b>2.)</b> Enable Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch.esp in the Oblivion launcher and the other optional plugins from the package.
<br><b>3.)</b> Make sure you've got some form of archive invalidation set. You can use Wrye Bash, OBMM, or the <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/10724">ArchiveInvalidation Invalidated!</a> for this.
<br><br>Manual installation of this or any other mod is STRONGLY discouraged. You should make use of Wrye Bash if at all possible. Using OBMM will work, but is not recommended. Absolutely <b>DO NOT</b> use Nexus Mod Manager to install this! NMM does not handle the installation of Oblivion files well and will cause things like missing meshes to crop up in your game because it seems to randomly skip files for no apparent reason.

<p class="h"><a name="uninstall">5. Uninstalling (BAIN)</a></p>
<b>1.)</b> Launch Wrye Bash, go to the Installers tab.
<br><b>2.)</b> Right click on the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch package, select uninstall. That should be it.
<br><br>Uninstalling the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch in the middle of a current save is not recommended. Doing so should only be done if you plan to start a new character.

<p class="h"><a name="uninstallM">6. Uninstalling (Manual)</a></p>
<b>1.)</b> Use the <b>Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch.7z</b> archive as a reference to what files you need to delete.
<br><br>Uninstalling the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch in the middle of a current save is not recommended. Doing so should only be done if you plan to start a new character.

<p class="h"><a name="faq">7. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</a></p>

<b>Q:</b> Do I still need the Unofficial Oblivion Patch?
<br><b>A:</b> Yes, the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch only fixes things added by the Shivering Isles expansion.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> Will this conflict with OOO/MMM/Frans etc.? Is it alright to use together?
<br><b>A:</b> Yes the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch does conflict but nothing that is known to cause problems, other than not receiving some of the advertised fixes from USIP; always load USIP before any other mod and you'll be fine.

<b>Question:</b> I see so many red conflicts with the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch and other mods!!! Will my game explode?!?
<br><b>Answer:</b> Nope! The file date of Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch.esp was set way back to the year 2002 so it will load first then your other plugins, in other words if something conflicts with USIP that plugin will override USIP's changes. <b>Note:</b> since USIP's changes are overridden some fixes might not work.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch.esp shows conflicts with Unofficial Oblivion Patch.esp! How come?
<br><b>A:</b> There are a few scripts that the UOP fixes that needed even more updating when Shivering Isles came along. For example, the UOP fixes a bug with the scripting for the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal, but Shivering Isles added another bug to it because of the split between normal and Shivering Isles bounties, so the same script needs to be in both. As long as Unofficial Oblivion Patch.esp loads before Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch.esp there should be no problems; any required fixes from the UOP will be in the USIP if they would be overridden.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch.esp is loading before Oblivion.esm!!! Won't my game get screwed up?
<br><b>A:</b> No, Oblivion loads ESM files (like Oblivion.esm) from oldest to newest first before loading ESP files (like Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch.esp) from oldest to newest.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> Will I have to start a new game for the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch to work?
<br><b>A:</b> Nope, the fixes were made to work on both new and existing games through some very minor changes (position of some objects) will only work in a new game or if you haven't visited that area in the game yet, really not worth restarting over.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I don't want to/can't install the latest official patch... can I still use the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch?
<br><b>A:</b> Yes you can but USIP may exacerbate some existing bugs in the game if you don't run it with version of Oblivion it was created for so use it at your own risk!

<br><br><b>Q:</b> Can I use the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch with the German version of Oblivion or other languages?
<br><b>A:</b> It should work fine but we can't test it also some things will appear in English instead of your game's language.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> So I have an older version of the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch, should I uninstall it first before upgrading or just upgrade over the top?
<br><b>A:</b> Best to uninstall first though it isn't needed.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> Do I need to use previous versions of the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch to get all the fixes?
<br><b>A:</b> Nope, latest version includes all previous fixes.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> So I've installed the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch but it still shows as v1.2.0416 in Oblivion, what's wrong?
<br><b>A:</b> Nothing is wrong! The Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch is a collection of fixes in the form of a ESP along with fixes in other files (NIF etc..) The Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch does not touch ANY Oblivion files on a default installation. If you want to see what version of the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch you are running then open the menu with <b>startquest usip</b> in the console while playing, or open up the Oblivion Launcher, click Data Files and then find and click the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch.esp.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> The reference ID bug (FBomb) was fixed in Oblivion v1.2.0416... so why don't you remove your fix for it then? I don't like useless clutter!
<br><b>A:</b> Even though the game was improved so reference ID's can be reused again it didn't actually fix the real bug, and that was a strange interaction between AI packages and scripts controlling the AI packages. Even with Oblivion v1.2.0416 those few guard scripts are still bugged and generating thousands of reference ID's every few seconds (won't cause the game to behave strangly like before though) draining CPU power for a pointless activity, the fix will remain in the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch until Bethesda actually fixes it.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I'm getting NO GREETING when I talk to NPC's, whats wrong?
<br><b>A:</b> The majority of the time this is caused by using mods or console commands that move you between Tamriel and Shivering Isles like Mark and Recall etc.; simply use the official gateway to the Shivering Isles and this will stop the problem from occuring and also correct it if you are already afflicted with it. <b>Note:</b> Some NPC's in Shivering Isles aren't meant to be talked to and thus when talked to you get NO GREETING, we've already fixed quite a few of these, and if you happen to find anymore please let us know.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> My game crashes when attacking Sheogorath, not meant to crash is it??
<br><b>A:</b> While quite humorous it isn't meant to crash. User Interface (UI) mods have been known to cause this problem; either remove them or upgrade them to a version that supports Shivering Isles.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> Do I still need the Unofficial Oblivion Patch?
<br><b>A:</b> Yes, Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch only fixes bugs in Shivering Isles or bugs Shivering Isles caused in Oblivion.
